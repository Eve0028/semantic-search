A '''spacer''' is a device used to increase the ease of administering aerosolized medication from a [[metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI). It adds space in the form of a tube or "chamber" between the mouth and canister of medication. Most spacers have a one-way valve that allows the person to inhale the medication while inhaling and exhaling normally; these are often referred to as '''valved holding chambers''' (VHC).

AeroChamber, InspirEase and Volumatic are examples of a spacer.

Spacers help those unable to breathe deeply, as well as those unable to synchronize their breathing so that they inhale just as the MDI is actuated; the latter is known as poor "hand-lung coordination".&lt;ref name=Nikanderp5&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Nikander |first1=Kurt|last2=Nicholls|first2=Clare|last3=Denyer|first3=John|last4=Pritchard|first4=John|year=2014|title=The Evolution of Spacers and Valved Holding Chambers |journal=Journal of Aerosol Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery|volume=27|issue=1|pages=(S4–S23), S5 |url=https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/jamp.2013.1076 |pmid=25054481|doi=10.1089/jamp.2013.1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;
__TOC__
==Terminology==
The term spacer is often used to refer to any tube-like MDI add-on device. Some spacers (e.g., InspirEase) utilize a collapsing bag design to provide visual feedback that successful inspiration is taking place. Another type (e.g., Volumatic) is transparent plastic in two vase-shaped parts that come together forming a barrel shape. Valved holding chambers (VHC) are commonly called "spacers" as well. 

==Application and benefits==
[[File:Asthma Inhaler (29172634251).jpg|thumb|[[Metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI); the mouthpiece slots into the back of the spacer.]]
To use an inhaler without a spacer requires coordinating several actions in a set order (pressing down on the inhaler, breathing in deeply as soon as the medication is released, holding your breath, exhaling), and not everyone is able to master this sequence. Use of a spacer, particularly a valved holding chamber, avoids such timing issues. Valved holding chambers are particularly useful for children, people with severe shortness of breath, and those with cognitive impairment.{{sfn|Nikander|Nicholls|Denyer|Pritchard|2014|p=S13}}

After removing the MDI's cap, the MDI mouthpiece is inserted into the back of the spacer. The front part of the chamber is closed off by either a mouthpiece or a mask that covers the mouth and nose. To administer the medication, the MDI is depressed once, resulting in the release of one dose of medication. The medication from the MDI is then suspended in the spacer's chamber while the person inhales the aerosolized medication by breathing in and out. The exhaled breath exits the device through the [[valve]]s rather than entering the chamber. Some spacers are equipped with a whistle, which sounds if the person is inhaling too quickly.

Spacers slow down the speed of the [[Particulate|aerosol]] coming from the inhaler, meaning that less of the [[asthma medication|asthma drug]] impacts on the back of the mouth and somewhat more may get into the lungs.&lt;ref name=Nikanderp5/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy''. 18th ed, Wiley, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;405.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[corticosteroid]]s, less residue in the mouth reduces the risk of developing [[oral candidiasis]], a yeast infection. Rinsing the mouth after application of inhaled steroids has a similar effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asthma.partners.org/newfiles/inhaledsteroids.html |title=Asthma and Inhaled Steroids |website=Asthma.partners.org|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas people with asthma can keep an MDI close-by at all times, the bulkiness of spacers can limit their use outside the home. Some research suggests that homemade spacers, using plastic bottles, may be as effective as commercially made versions, but homemade versions may have more variability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalasthmareport.org/Global%20Asthma%20Report%202018.pdf|title=Global Asthma Report 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Global Asthma Network|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024182328/http://globalasthmareport.org:80/Global%20Asthma%20Report%202018.pdf |archive-date=2018-10-24 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction''' ('''EIB''') occurs when the airways narrow as a result of exercise.  This condition has been referred to as '''exercise-induced asthma''' ('''EIA'''), however this term is no longer preferred. While exercise does not cause [[asthma]], it is frequently an [[asthma trigger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khan|first=DA|title=Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: burden and prevalence|journal=Allergy and Asthma Proceedings|date=Jan–Feb 2012|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–6|pmid=22370526|doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be expected that people with E.I.B. would present with [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], and/or an [[tachypnea|elevated respiratory rate]] and [[wheezing]], consistent with an asthma attack.  However, many will present with decreased stamina, or difficulty in recovering from exertion compared to team members, or paroxysmal coughing from an irritable airway.&lt;ref name=Parsons&gt;{{cite journal | title=Screening for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in college athletes |vauthors=Parsons JP, Cosmar D, Phillips G, Kaeding C, Best TM, Mastronarde JG | date=March 2012 | journal=J Asthma | volume=49 |issue=2 | pages=153–7 | pmid=22276571 |  doi= 10.3109/02770903.2011.652329 |pmc=3832203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, examination may reveal wheezing and  prolonged expiratory phase, or may be quite normal.  Consequently, a potential for under-diagnosis exists.  Measurement of airflow, such as peak expiratory flow rates, which can be done inexpensively on the track or sideline, may prove helpful. In athletes, symptoms of bronchospasm such as chest discomfort, breathlessness, and fatigue are often falsely attributed to the individual being “out of shape”, having asthma, or possessing a hyperreactive airway rather than EIB &lt;ref name="Parsons &amp; Mastronade"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction in Athletes |vauthors=Parsons JP, Mastronarde JG |journal=Chest |date=24 December 2015 |volume=128 |issue=6 |pages=3966–3974 |doi=10.1016/S0012-3692(15)49641-2 |pmid=16354868 |s2cid=38398971 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215496412 |access-date=28 November 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cause==
While the potential triggering events for EIB are well recognized, the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood.&lt;ref name=CAAR&gt;{{cite journal | title=Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction: Pathogenesis |vauthors=Anderson SD, Kippelen P |date=March 2005 | journal=Current Allergy and Asthma Reports | volume=5 |issue=2 | pages=116–22 | doi= 10.1007/s11882-005-0084-y |pmid=15683611|s2cid=11816261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It usually occurs after at least several minutes of vigorous, [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] activity, which increases oxygen demand to the point where breathing through the nose (nasal breathing) must be supplemented by mouth breathing.  The resultant inhalation of air that has not been warmed and humidified by the nasal passages seems to generate increased blood flow to the linings of the bronchial tree, resulting in [[edema]].  Constriction of these small airways then follows, worsening the degree of obstruction to airflow.  There is increasing evidence that the smooth muscle that lines the airways becomes progressively more sensitive to changes that occur as a result of injury to the airways from dehydration.  The chemical mediators that provoke the muscle spasm appear to arise from [[mast cell]]s.&lt;ref name=CAAR /&gt; Mouth breathing as a result of decreased nasal breathing also increases lung surface exposure to irritants, pollutants, and allergens, causing neutrophilic inflammation in response to reactive oxygen species formation; research has found that individuals with genetically hindered glutathione counteraction of this oxidative stress are likely at a higher risk of developing EIB.&lt;ref name=TIFL&gt; {{cite book | last1=Gerow |first1=M |last2= Bruner |first2=PJ |date=January 2023 | title=Exercise-Induced Asthma |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557554/ |location=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing LLC |pmid=32491486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be difficult to diagnose clinically given the lack of specific symptoms&lt;ref name=Parsons /&gt; and frequent misinterpretation as manifestations of vigorous exercise.  There are many mimics that present with similar symptoms, such as [[vocal cord dysfunction]], [[cardiac arrhythmias]], [[cardiomyopathies]], and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].  It is also important to distinguish those who have asthma with exercise worsening, and who consequently will have abnormal testing at rest, from true exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, where there will be normal baseline results.  Because of the wide differential diagnosis of exertional respiratory complaints, the diagnosis of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction based on history and self-reported symptoms alone has been shown to be inaccurate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hallstrand TS, Curtis JR, Koepsell TD, etal |title=Effectiveness of screening examinations to detect unrecognized exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |journal=J. Pediatr. |volume=141 |issue=3 |pages=343–8 |date=September 2002 |pmid=12219053 |doi=10.1067/mpd.2002.125729 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rundell KW, Im J, Mayers LB, Wilber RL, Szmedra L, Schmitz HR |title=Self-reported symptoms and exercise-induced asthma in the elite athlete |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=208–13 |date=February 2001 |pmid=11224807 |doi=10.1097/00005768-200102000-00006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will result in an incorrect diagnosis more than 50% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parsons JP, Kaeding C, Phillips G, Jarjoura D, Wadley G, Mastronarde JG |title=Prevalence of exercise-induced bronchospasm in a cohort of varsity college athletes |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=39 |issue=9 |pages=1487–92 |date=September 2007 |pmid=17805078 |doi=10.1249/mss.0b013e3180986e45 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important and often overlooked differential diagnosis is [[Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction | Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO)]]. The latter can co-exist with EIB and is best differentiated using objective testing and continuous laryngoscopy during exercise (CLE) testing. 

===Spirometry===
Objective testing should begin with [[spirometry]] at rest. In true exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the results should be within normal limits. Should resting values be abnormal, then asthma, or some other chronic lung condition, is present. There is, of course, no reason why asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction should not co-exist but the distinction is important because without successful treatment of underlying asthma, treatment of an exercise component will likely be unsuccessful.  If baseline testing is normal, some form of exercise or pharmacologic stress will be required, either on the sideline or practice venue, or in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=ERS&gt;{{cite journal | title=Exercise-induced asthma, respiratory and allergic disorders in elite athletes: epidemiology, mechanisms and diagnosis: Part I of the report from the Joint Task Force of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) in cooperation with GA2LEN  |vauthors=Carlsen KH, Anderson SD, Bjermer L, etal | date=April 2008 | journal=Allergy | volume=63 |issue=4 | pages=387–403 | doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01662.x |pmid=18315727| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise testing ===
Treadmill or ergometer-based testing in lung function laboratories are effective methods for diagnosing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but may result in false negatives if the exercise stimulus is not intense enough.

=== Field-exercise challenge ===
Field-exercise challenge tests that involve the athlete performing the sport in which they are normally involved and assessing [[FEV1/FVC ratio|FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]] after exercise are helpful if abnormal but have been shown to be less sensitive than eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation.&lt;ref name="pmid10084470"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mannix ET, Manfredi F, Farber MO | s2cid=2599863 | title=A comparison of two challenge tests for identifying exercise-induced bronchospasm in figure skaters | journal=Chest | year= 1999 | volume= 115 | issue= 3 | pages= 649–53 | pmid=10084470 | doi= 10.1378/chest.115.3.649}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation challenge ====
The [[International Olympic Committee]] recommends the [[eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation]] (EVH) challenge as the test to document exercise-induced asthma  in [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] athletes.&lt;ref name="McKeagMoeller2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Douglas B. McKeag|author2=James L. Moeller|author3=American College of Sports Medicine|title=ACSM's Primary Care Sports Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoeRrA_-td0C&amp;pg=PA167|access-date=21 April 2012|date=3 July 2007|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7028-6|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the EVH challenge, the patient voluntarily, without exercising, rapidly breathes dry air enriched with 5% {{CO2}} for six minutes.  The presence of the enriched {{CO2}} compensates for the {{CO2}} losses in the expired air, not matched by metabolic production, that occurs during hyperventilation, and so maintains {{CO2}} levels at normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosenthal |first=Richard |title=Eucapnic Voluntary Hyperventilation (EVH) A Test for the Presence of Asthma |url=http://image.lifeservant.com/siteuploadfiles/VSYM/E771344B-4428-4E27-8A0E0700B4A4CA31/098823F8-C29A-8FCE-4EC63CCB218901DC.doc |access-date=2014-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531104931/http://image.lifeservant.com/siteuploadfiles/VSYM/E771344B-4428-4E27-8A0E0700B4A4CA31/098823F8-C29A-8FCE-4EC63CCB218901DC.doc |archive-date=2014-05-31 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medication challenge ====

==Treatment==
{{further|Asthma#Management}}

===Lifestyle===
The best treatment is avoidance of conditions predisposing to attacks, when possible.  In athletes who wish to continue their sport or do so in adverse conditions, preventive measures include altered training techniques and medications.

Some take advantage of the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] by precipitating an attack by "warming up," and then timing competition such that it occurs during the refractory period.  Step-wise training works in a similar fashion.  Warm up occurs in stages of increasing intensity, using the refractory period generated by each stage to reach a full workload.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Effect of warm-up exercise on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |vauthors=Stickland MK, Rowe BH, Spooner CH, Vandermeer B, Dryden DM |s2cid=343413 | date=March 2012 | journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc | volume=44 | pages=383–91 | pmid=21811185 | doi=10.1249/MSS.0b013e31822fb73a | issue=3| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
There is no evidence supporting different treatment for EIB in asthmatic athletes and nonathletes.&lt;ref name=ERS2/&gt; The most common medication used is a [[beta agonist]] taken about 20 minutes before exercise.&lt;ref name=ERS2&gt;{{cite journal | title=Treatment of exercise-induced asthma, respiratory and allergic disorders in sports and the relationship to doping: Part II of the report from the Joint Task Force of European Respiratory Society (ERS) and European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) in cooperation with GA2LEN  |vauthors=Carlsen KH, Anderson SD, Bjermer L, etal | date=April 2008 | journal=Allergy | volume=63 |issue=4 | pages=492–505 | doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2008.01663.x | pmid=18394123| doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physicians prescribe inhaled anti-inflammatory mists such as [[corticosteroids]] or [[leukotriene antagonist]]s, and [[mast cell stabilizer]]s have also proven effective.&lt;ref name=ERS2 /&gt;

In May 2013, the [[American Thoracic Society]] issued the first treatment guidelines for EIB, recommending use of "a short-acting β2-agonist before exercise in all patients with EIB. For patients who continue to have symptoms of EIB despite the administration of a short-acting β2-agonist before exercise, strong recommendations were made for a daily inhaled corticosteroid, a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist, or a mast cell stabilizing agent before exercise."&lt;ref name=ATS2013&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Parsons JP, Hallstrand TS, Mastronarde JG, etal |s2cid=32941118 |title=An Official American Thoracic Society Clinical Practice Guideline: Exercise-induced Bronchoconstriction |journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |volume=187 |issue=9 |pages=1016–27 |date=May 2013 |pmid=23634861 |doi=10.1164/rccm.201303-0437ST|url=https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/full/10.1164/rccm.201303-0437ST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===
A [[crossover study]] compared oral [[montelukast]] with inhaled [[salmeterol]], both given two hours before exercise, showing that the drugs had similar benefit.&lt;ref name="pmid17573489"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Philip G, Pearlman DS, Villarán C, etal |title=Single-dose montelukast or salmeterol as protection against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction |journal=Chest |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=875–83 |year=2007 |pmid=17573489 |doi=10.1378/chest.07-0550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
As evidenced by many professional athletes who have overcome EIB using some combination of accepted treatments, the prognosis is usually very good.{{dubious|date=August 2013}} Olympic swimmers [[Tom Dolan]], [[Amy Van Dyken]], and [[Nancy Hogshead]], Olympic track star [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]], baseball Hall of Famer [[Catfish Hunter]], and American football player [[Jerome Bettis]] are among the many who have done so.

'''Heliox''' is a [[breathing gas]] mixture of [[helium]] (He) and [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It is used as a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing because this mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs. It is also used as a breathing gas diluent for deep ambient pressure diving as it is not narcotic at high pressure, and for its low work of breathing.

Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barach AL, Eckman M | title = The effects of inhalation of helium mixed with oxygen on the mechanics of respiration | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 47–61 | date = January 1936 | pmid = 16694380 | pmc = 424760 | doi = 10.1172/JCI100758 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BOCMprod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/heliox.asp |title=Heliox product information |publisher=BOC Medical |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121031022/http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/heliox.asp |archive-date=21 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heliox is also used in [[saturation diving]] and sometimes during the deep phase of [[technical diving|technical dives]].&lt;ref name=usn&gt;{{cite book |title=US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision |year=2008 |publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command |location=United States |url=http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&amp;pageID=3.9 |access-date=2008-07-08 |archive-date=2008-05-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502023541/http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&amp;pageId=3.9 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brubakk&gt;{{cite book |title=Bennett and Elliott's physiology and medicine of diving | edition = 5th Rev | vauthors = Brubakk AO, Neuman TS |year=2003 |publisher=Saunders Ltd. |location=United States |isbn=0-7020-2571-2 |pages=800 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.divingheritage.com/moderncomex.htm | title = COMEX PRO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical uses ==
In [[medicine]] heliox may refer to a mixture of 21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the same as [[air]]) and 79% He, although other combinations are available (70/30 and 60/40).

Heliox generates less airway resistance than air and thereby requires less mechanical energy to ventilate the lungs.&lt;ref name="BOCheox21"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bochealthcare.co.uk/en/products/heliox/index.shtml |title=Heliox21 |publisher=Linde Gas Therapeutics |date=27 January 2009 |access-date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Work of breathing]]" (WOB) is reduced by two mechanisms:
# increased tendency to [[laminar flow]];
# reduced resistance in [[turbulent flow]] due to lower density.
Heliox 20/80 diffuses 1.8 times faster than oxygen, and the flow of heliox 20/80 from an oxygen flowmeter is 1.8 times the normal flow for oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hess DR, Fink JB, Venkataraman ST, Kim IK, Myers TR, Tano BD | title = The history and physics of heliox | journal = Respiratory Care | volume = 51 | issue = 6 | pages = 608–612 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16723037 | url = https://rc.rcjournal.com/content/respcare/51/6/608.full.pdf | url-status = live | archive-url = https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://rc.rcjournal.com/content/respcare/51/6/608.full.pdf | archive-date = 2022-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heliox has a similar [[viscosity]] to air but a significantly lower [[density]] (0.5&amp;nbsp;g/L versus 1.25&amp;nbsp;g/L at [[Standard temperature and pressure|STP]]). Flow of gas through the airway comprises laminar flow, transitional flow and turbulent flow. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the [[Reynolds number]]. Heliox's low density produces a lower Reynolds number and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. Laminar flow tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow.

In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas viscosity and is not related to density and so heliox has little effect. The [[Hagen–Poiseuille equation]] describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so heliox has a significant effect.

There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways ([[croup]], asthma and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]]). A recent trial has suggested that lower fractions of helium (below 40%){{snd}} thus allowing a higher fraction of oxygen{{snd}} might also have the same beneficial effect on upper airway obstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Truebel H, Wuester S, Boehme P, Doll H, Schmiedl S, Szymanski J, Langer T, Ostermann T, Cysarz D, Thuermann P | display-authors = 6 | title = A proof-of-concept trial of HELIOX with different fractions of helium in a human study modeling upper airway obstruction | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 119 | issue = 5 | pages = 1253–1260 | date = May 2019 | pmid = 30850876 | doi = 10.1007/s00421-019-04116-7 | s2cid = 71715570 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with these conditions may develop a range of symptoms including [[dyspnea]] (breathlessness), hypoxemia (below-normal oxygen content in the arterial blood) and eventually a weakening of the respiratory muscles due to [[Fatigue|exhaustion]], which can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe.&lt;ref name="BOCMdata"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/Medical_Helium_Oxygen_Mix_172.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.bocmedical.co.uk/product_information/Medical_Helium_Oxygen_Mix_172.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Heliox data sheet |author=BOC Medical}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly.&lt;ref name="AnaesUK"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee DL, Hsu CW, Lee H, Chang HW, Huang YC | title = Beneficial effects of albuterol therapy driven by heliox versus by oxygen in severe asthma exacerbation | journal = Academic Emergency Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 820–827 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16141015 | doi = 10.1197/j.aem.2005.04.020 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also indicated advantages in using helium–oxygen mixtures in delivery of [[anaesthesia]].&lt;ref name="BJA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buczkowski PW, Fombon FN, Russell WC, Thompson JP | title = Effects of helium on high frequency jet ventilation in model of airway stenosis | journal = British Journal of Anaesthesia | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 701–705 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16143576 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aei229 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute [[asthma]] before the advent of [[bronchodilators]]. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and [[vocal cord dysfunction]]).

Helium diluted breathing gases are used to eliminate or reduce the effects of [[inert gas narcosis]], and to reduce [[work of breathing]] due to increased gas density at depth. From the 1960s saturation diving physiology studies were conducted with helium from {{convert|45|to|610|m|ft|abbr=on}} over several decades by a Hyperbaric Experimental Centre operated by the French company [[Compagnie maritime d'expertises|COMEX]] specializing in engineering and deep diving operations.&lt;ref name="Hydra 8"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comex.fr/suite/ceh/histo/histo%20anglais.html |title=Extreme Environment Engineering Departement Hyperbaric Experimental Centre - History |access-date=2009-02-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005073910/http://www.comex.fr/suite/ceh/histo/histo%20anglais.html |archive-date=October 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the expense of helium,&lt;ref name="Fills"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fillexpress.com/fills.shtml#prices |title=Example pricing for filling cylinders |access-date=2008-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116133910/http://fillexpress.com/fills.shtml#prices |archive-date=2008-01-16 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt; heliox is most likely to be used in deep [[saturation diving]]. It is also sometimes used by [[Technical diving|technical divers]], particularly those using [[Diving rebreather|rebreathers]], which conserve the breathing gas at depth much better than [[open circuit scuba]].

The proportion of oxygen in a diving mix depends on the maximum depth of the dive plan, but it is often [[wiktionary:hypoxic|hypoxic]] and may be less than 10%. Each mix is custom made using [[gas blending]] techniques, which often involve the use of [[booster pump]]s to achieve typical [[diving cylinder]] pressures of {{convert|200 to 300|bar|psi|abbr=on|lk=on}} from lower pressure banks of oxygen and helium cylinders.

Because [[sound]] travels faster in heliox than in air, [[human voice|voice]] [[formant]]s are raised, making divers' speech very high-pitched and hard to understand to people not used to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ackerman MJ, Maitland G | title = Calculation of the relative speed of sound in a gas mixture | journal = Undersea Biomedical Research | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 305–310 | date = December 1975 | pmid = 1226588 | url = http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2738 | access-date = 2008-07-08 | url-status = usurped | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110127113335/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/2738 | archive-date = 2011-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface personnel often employ a piece of communications equipment called a "helium de-scrambler", which electronically lowers the pitch of the diver's voice as it is relayed through the communications gear, making it easier to understand.

[[Trimix (breathing gas)|Trimix]] is a less expensive alternative to heliox for deep diving, which uses only enough helium to limit narcosis and gas density to tolerable levels for the planned depth.&lt;ref name=stone&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stone WC |year=1992 |title=The case for heliox: a matter of narcosis and economics. |journal=AquaCorps |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=11–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trimix is often used in [[technical diving]], and is also sometimes used in [[professional diving]].

In 2015, the [[United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit]] showed that decompression from bounce dives using trimix is not more efficient  than dives on heliox.&lt;ref name=NEDU2015-4&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doolette DJ, Gault KA, Gerth WA |year=2015 |title=Decompression from He-N2-O2 (trimix) bounce dives is not more efficient than from He-O2 (heliox) bounce dives. |journal=US Navy Experimental Diving Unit Technical Report 15-4 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/10576 |access-date=2015-12-30 |archive-date=2017-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707084659/http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/xmlui/handle/123456789/10576 |url-status=usurped }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inhaler''' (also known as a '''puffer''', '''pump''' or '''allergy spray''') is a medical device used for delivering medicines into the lungs through the work of a person's breathing. This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) being among the most notable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the common types of inhalers include [[metered-dose inhaler]]s, [[dry powder inhaler]]s, soft mist inhalers, and [[nebulizer]]s. Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on individually specific patient needs, as well as age, pathological conditions, coordination, and lung function.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = DePietro M, Gilbert I, Millette LA, Riebe M | title = Inhalation device options for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | journal = Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 130 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–97 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29210318 | doi = 10.1080/00325481.2018.1399042 | s2cid = 705448 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication creates its proper effects in the lungs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Medical uses==
Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications when administered locally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with [[Pulmonary diseases|diseases of the lungs]] and [[respiratory system]] being among the most common. Individuals with these diseases/conditions need medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and comfortable breathing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vardakas KZ, Voulgaris GL, Samonis G, Falagas ME | title = Inhaled colistin monotherapy for respiratory tract infections in adults without cystic fibrosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–9 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 28669836 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2017.05.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are [[asthma]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothe T, Spagnolo P, Bridevaux PO, Clarenbach C, Eich-Wanger C, Meyer F, Miedinger D, Möller A, Nicod LP, Nicolet-Chatelain G, Sauty A, Steurer-Stey C, Leuppi JD | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnosis and Management of Asthma - The Swiss Guidelines | journal = Respiration; International Review of Thoracic Diseases | volume = 95 | issue = 5 | pages = 364–380 | date = 2018 | pmid = 29614508 | doi = 10.1159/000486797 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stolz D, Barandun J, Borer H, Bridevaux PO, Brun P, Brutsche M, Clarenbach C, Eich C, Fiechter R, Frey M, Geiser T, Grob M, Helfenstein E, Junker L, Kohler M, Latshang T, Lechmann A, Maurer M, Nicod L, Quadri F, Schilter D, Sigrist T, Soccal P, Tarr P, Thurnheer R, Turk A, Tamm M | display-authors = 6 | title = Diagnosis, Prevention and Treatment of Stable COPD and Acute Exacerbations of COPD: The Swiss Recommendations 2018 | journal = Respiration; International Review of Thoracic Diseases | volume = 96 | issue = 4 | pages = 382–398 | date = 2018 | pmid = 30138943 | doi = 10.1159/000490551 | s2cid = 52074520 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asthma===

[[Asthma]] is a condition of intermittent [[airway obstruction]] due to [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] processes in the lungs. Inhaled medications are used to calm down the inflammation present in the lungs and allow for relief of the airway obstruction. Common inhaled medications used for treatment of asthma are [[bronchodilator]]s such as [[salbutamol]], [[corticosteroid]]s, and [[salmeterol]]. These medications allow for patients to have relief of airway obstruction symptoms and reduced inflammation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If some people are unable to use inhalers, [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)]] may be used, but with caution since they may cause immunological [[hypersensitivity]] to NSAIDs, resulting in respiratory-related symptoms such as [[bronchospasm]]s, acute [[asthma exacerbation]], and severe asthma morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lo|first1=Pei-Chia|last2=Tsai|first2=Yueh-Ting|last3=Lin|first3=Shun-Ku|last4=Lai|first4=Jung-Nien|date=14 October 2016|title=Risk of asthma exacerbation associated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in childhood asthma|journal=Medicine|volume=95|issue=41|pages=e5109|doi=10.1097/MD.0000000000005109|issn=0025-7974|pmc=5072955|pmid=27741128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Woo|first1=Seong-Dae|last2=Luu|first2=Quoc Quang|last3=Park|first3=Hae-Sim|date=28 July 2020|title=NSAID-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease (NERD): From Pathogenesis to Improved Care|journal=Frontiers in Pharmacology|volume=11|pages=1147|doi=10.3389/fphar.2020.01147|pmid=32848759|pmc=7399220|issn=1663-9812|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)===

COPD is an obstructive lung disease due to long-term damage to the airways of the lungs. The long-term damage leads to the inability of the airways to open properly, causing [[airway obstruction]]. Inhaled medications allow patients to see improvement in symptoms and better function of daily living. Some commonly used inhaled medications in patient's with COPD are [[Ipratropium bromide|ipratroprium]], [[salmeterol]], and [[corticosteroid]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Types==
===Meter-dosed inhaler (MDI)===
The most common type of inhaler is the pressurized [[metered-dose inhaler]] (MDI) which is made up of 3 standard components- a metal canister, plastic actuator, and a metering valve. The medication is typically stored in solution in a pressurized canister that contains a propellant or suspension. The MDI canister is attached to a plastic, hand-operated actuator. On activation, the metered-dose inhaler releases a fixed dose of medication in [[Aerosol spray|aerosol]] form through the actuator and into a patient's lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/pharmaceuticalin134anth|title=Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker|year=2004|editor=Hickey, A.J.|edition=2nd|location=NY|isbn=9780824742539|url-access=registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These devices require significant coordination as a person must discharge the medication at or near the same time that they inhale in order for the medication to be effective.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Navaie M, Dembek C, Cho-Reyes S, Yeh K, Celli BR | title = Device use errors with soft mist inhalers: A global systematic literature review and meta-analysis | journal = Chronic Respiratory Disease | volume = 17 | pages = 1479973119901234 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31984767 | pmc = 6985977 | doi = 10.1177/1479973119901234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dry powder inhalers.jpg|alt=|thumb|Different types of [[Dry-powder inhaler|dry powder inhalers]]]]

===Dry powder inhaler (DPI)===
[[Dry-powder inhaler|Dry powder inhaler]]s release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device. This device usually contains a chamber in which the powdered medication is deposited prior to each dosage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The powder can then be inhaled with a quick breath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This allows for medication to be delivered to the lungs without the need for use of propellant/suspension.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Soft mist inhaler (SMI)===
[[File:Nebulizer Mask (Child).png|thumb|[[Nebulizer]] with face mask]]
Soft mist inhalers release a light mist containing medication without the need for a propellant/suspension. Upon pressing a button, the inhaler creates a mist of medication, allowing for inhalation into the lungs. SMIs suspend inhaled medications for roughly 1.2 seconds, which is longer than the average MDI inhaler suspension time period.  This requires less coordination when using and may be helpful for young patients or patients that find the MDI inhalers difficult to use.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Nebulizer===
[[Nebulizer]]s are designed to deliver medications over an extended period of time over multiple breaths through a mouthpiece or face mask.  They generate a continuous mist with aerosolized medication, allowing a patient to breathe normally and receive medications.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  They are commonly used in infants and toddlers requiring inhaled medications or in patients in the hospital who require inhaled medications.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Smart inhaler===
The smart-inhaler is an inhaler that will automatically update an app with information that includes the time of day, air quality, and how many times it has been used through sensor technology on the device.&lt;ref name = "Himes_2019"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Himes BE, Leszinsky L, Walsh R, Hepner H, Wu AC | title = Mobile Health and Inhaler-Based Monitoring Devices for Asthma Management | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 2535–2543 | date = November 2019 | pmid = 31706485 | pmc = 6917046 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2019.08.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first smart-inhaler was approved in 2019 by the FDA, its purpose is to track patient use of the device and some other circumstantial factors that could affect the effectiveness of the dosage.&lt;ref name = "Himes_2019" /&gt; This information is sent via Bluetooth to a mobile device app, and is later shared with their physician to determine what kind of things can trigger issues with asthma and other problems.&lt;ref name = "Himes_2019" /&gt; This technology presents a great way to cut down on medical costs associated with asthma and also help patients better manage their condition with fewer emergencies.

The Teva ProAir Digihaler was the first FDA approved smart inhaler.&lt;ref name = "Chrystyn_2019"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chrystyn H, Safioti G, Buck D, Granovsky L, Calderon E, Li T, Reich M, Hill T, Depietro M, Pleasants R | display-authors = 6 |date=2019-09-28|title=Real-life inhaler technique in asthma patients using the electronic ProAir Digihaler |journal=Airway Pharmacology and Treatment|publisher=European Respiratory Society|pages=PA4258|doi=10.1183/13993003.congress-2019.PA4258| s2cid = 214096707 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows how effective the device is at aiding patients in using the proper dose amount for their asthma. In a study published by the European Respiratory Journal, the ProAir Digihaler accurately identified when patients were using their inhalers and whether they were effectively administering the dose in a 370 patient trial with the device.&lt;ref name = "Chrystyn_2019" /&gt; This study further gives an overview on the technology regarding applications and devices that help aid in the tracking and medication management for asthma and other lung conditions. Another study showed that smart inhalers accurately recorded all doses administered by patients with their technology, which signifies their importance in providing accurate dosage information to patients and their physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burgess SW, Wilson SS, Cooper DM, Sly PD, Devadason SG | title = In vitro evaluation of an asthma dosing device: the smart-inhaler | journal = Respiratory Medicine | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 841–5 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16216485 | doi = 10.1016/j.rmed.2005.09.004 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propellants==
In 2009, the FDA banned the use of inhalers that use [[chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFC) as [[Propellant#Compressed_fluid_propellants|propellants]]. In their place, inhalers now use [[hydrofluoroalkane]] (HFA). HFA is not environmentally inert as it is a [[greenhouse gas]] but it does not affect the [[ozone layer]].&lt;ref name=baumann/&gt; While some people with asthma and advocacy groups contend that HFA inhalers are not as effective,&lt;ref name="storyid1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ksdk.com/news/living_green/story.aspx?storyid=149094&amp;catid=116 |title=Asthma Group Concerned "Green" Inhalers May Not be as Effective &amp;#124; ksdk.com &amp;#124; St. Louis, MO |publisher=ksdk.com |access-date=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; published clinical studies indicate CFC and HFA inhalers are equally effective in controlling asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hendeles L, Colice GL, Meyer RJ |title=Withdrawal of albuterol inhalers containing chlorofluorocarbon propellants |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=356 |issue=13 |pages=1344–51 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17392304 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra050380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the impact of CFCs from inhalers on the ozone layer had been minuscule (dwarfed by industrial processes using CFCs), the FDA in its interpretation of the [[Montreal Protocol]] mandated the switch in propellants.&lt;ref name=baumann&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2011/07/cost-increase-asthma-inhalers-expensive |author=Nick Baumann |title=Why You're Paying More to Breathe| journal=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=July–August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients expressed concern about the high price of the HFA inhalers as there were initially no generic versions, whereas generic CFC inhalers had been available.&lt;ref name="storyid1"/&gt;

==Proper use==
{{manual|section|date=August 2021}}
It is important to use proper technique when administering inhalers to self or others. Improper use of inhalers is very common, can lead to distribution of the medicine into the mouth or throat where it cannot create its desired effect and may cause harm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3): Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma-Summary Report 2007 | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 120 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = S94-138 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17983880 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2007.09.043 | author1 = National Asthma Education Prevention Program }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho-Reyes S, Celli BR, Dembek C, Yeh K, Navaie M | title = Inhalation Technique Errors with Metered-Dose Inhalers Among Patients with Obstructive Lung Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of U.S. Studies | journal = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–280 | date = July 2019 | pmid = 31342732 | pmc = 6872219 | doi = 10.15326/jcopdf.6.3.2018.0168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sanchis|first1=Joaquin|last2=Gich|first2=Ignasi|last3=Pedersen|first3=Soren|date=1 August 2016|title=Systematic Review of Errors in Inhaler Use: Has Patient Technique Improved Over Time?|journal=Chest|language=en|volume=150|issue=2|pages=394–406|doi=10.1016/j.chest.2016.03.041|pmid=27060726|s2cid=27941333 |issn=0012-3692|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education on the correct use of inhalers for delivery of medications is a commonly cited topic in medical studies and a great deal of thought has been put into how best to help people learn to use their inhalers effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris K, Kneale D, Lasserson TJ, McDonald VM, Grigg J, Thomas J | title = School-based self-management interventions for asthma in children and adolescents: a mixed methods systematic review | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD011651 | date = January 2019 | issue = 1 | pmid = 30687940 | pmc = 6353176 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011651.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maricoto T, Monteiro L, Gama JM, Correia-de-Sousa J, Taborda-Barata L | title = Inhaler Technique Education and Exacerbation Risk in Older Adults with Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–66 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30291745 | doi = 10.1111/jgs.15602 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Below is a description of proper inhaler technique for each different type of inhaler as well as a helpful video explaining what the text states.

[[File:Using an inhaler.webm|thumb|Using an inhaler]]

===Meter-dosed inhalers===

1. The mouthpiece is removed and the inhaler is shaken for 5–10 seconds

2. The inhaler is gripped with mouthpiece on the bottom and canister on top.  A finger is placed on the canister to allow for delivery of medicine.

3. Once complete exhalation is done, mouth is placed over mouthpiece.

4. As inhalation begins, the canister is pressed down to releases the medicine into the lungs.

5. Slow [[deep breathing]] is continued and breath is held for 5–10 seconds, keeping the medicine in the lungs and preventing escape of aerosolized form of the medicine.

6. Complete exhalation is done again. If multiple puffs of the medicine have to be taken, steps 1–5 are repeated after waiting for 15–30 seconds.

7. Mouthpiece is replaced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===With spacer===

Spacer is placed at the mouthpiece of a meter-dosed inhaler while keeping mouth at the end of the spacer. Deep breathing is done to be ready for the delivery of the medicine to the lungs, and then the canister is pressed down.  This minimizes need for coordination of breathing with inhaler activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Dry powder inhalers===
1. Inhaler medication chamber is prepared (this will be different based on the type of inhaler but will involve preparing and opening the chamber with the medication)

2. The inhaler is held with the chamber pointing towards the patient and complete exhalation is done with their head turned away from the inhaler.

3. Mouth is placed over the chamber and a quick, deep breath is taken allowing medication to dispense in the lungs.

4. Breath is held for 5–10 seconds and then slow exhalation is done.

5. After waiting for a few minutes, steps 1-4 are repeated if another dose is needed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Soft mist inhalers===

1. The inhaler is primed by loading the cartridge and discharging the inhaler until a fine mist is visible ([[:File:Using an inhaler.webm|more explanation in the video]]).

2. Once complete exhalation is done, mouth is placed around the mouthpiece while leaving space for the small holes on the side of the mouthpiece.

3. Slow inhalation is done while simultaneously pressing the button to release the medication.

4. Breath is held for 5–10 seconds.

5. Slow exhalation is done and steps 1-4 are repeated if another dose of medication is required after waiting for a few minutes.

If inhaler is used everyday, the inhaler usually has to be primed the first time using a new cartridge, but it may need to be primed again if it has not been used in multiple days.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===After use===

If using inhaled [[corticosteroid]]s, rinse mouth out directly after use of inhaler. This helps to prevent [[infection]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Nebulizer===

1. Mouth is placed over mouthpiece or face mask is placed over nose and mouth

2. The nebulizer machine is turned on.

3. Normal breathing is done for 10-20 min (or time allotted for treatment).

4.  Machine is turned off and face mask/mouthpiece remove is removed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Price and availability==

In the United States, pharmaceutical manufacturers use legal and regulatory strategies to keep inhaler prices artificially high. There has been little innovation in inhaler technology for decades {{mdash}} the most recent drug to be approved by the FDA for treating asthma or COPD via a novel [[Biological target|target of action]] was [[Ipratropium bromide]] in 1986. Since then, manufacturers have used small changes to drug delivery mechanisms, or have switched active ingredients from one inhaler device to another (a strategy known as a "device hop") to keep patents active. This has the effect of limiting competition, keeping inhalers expensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Patents And Regulatory Exclusivities On Inhalers For Asthma And COPD, 1986–2020 |date=May 17, 2022 |first1=William B. |last1=Feldman |first2=Doni |last2=Bloomfield |first3=Reed F. |last3=Beall |first4=Aaron S. |last4=Kesselheim |doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2021.01874 |journal=Health Affairs |volume=41 |number=6 |pages=787–796 |pmid=35579925 |pmc=10328096 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of high prices, patients sometimes skip doses or give up using their inhalers.

==History==
[[File:PenetroInhalador.JPG|thumb|upright|Penetro brand inhaler from mid 20th century Mexico, part of the permanent collection of the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]]]]
[[File:Mudge inhaler.jpg|thumb|upright|Inhaler designed by John Mudge in 1778]]
The idea of directly delivering medication into the lungs was based on ancient traditional cures that involved the use of aromatic and medicinal vapors. These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vaporize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Inhalation in the treatment of disease: its therapeutics and practice| author=Cohen, J.

[[File:Beigel mouthpiece.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mouthpiece for an inhaler designed by Dr Beigel (1867)]]
In 1968, Robert Wexler of [[Abbott Laboratories]] developed the Analgizer, a disposable inhaler that allowed the self-administration of [[methoxyflurane]] [[vapor]] in air for [[analgesia]].&lt;ref name=Wexler1968/&gt; The Analgizer consisted of a [[polyethylene]] cylinder 5&amp;nbsp;inches long and 1&amp;nbsp;inch in diameter with a 1&amp;nbsp;inch long mouthpiece. The device contained a rolled [[Candle wick|wick]] of [[polypropylene]] [[felt]] which held 15&amp;nbsp;[[Litre#SI prefixes applied to the litre|milliliters]] of methoxyflurane.

Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the [[Pharmacology|pharmacological]] characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of [[Procedural sedation and analgesia|conscious analgesia]] which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15&amp;nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly [[Amnesia|amnesic]] to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.&lt;ref name=Romagnoli1970/&gt;

The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with [[bone fracture]]s and [[joint dislocation]]s,&lt;ref name=Romagnoli1970/&gt; and for dressing changes on [[burn]] patients.&lt;ref name=Packer1969/&gt; When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent [[adverse effect]] on [[Apgar score]]s.&lt;ref name=Romagnoli1970/&gt; All [[vital signs]] remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients.&lt;ref name=Romagnoli1970/&gt; The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and [[sedation]] until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the [[patient-controlled analgesia]] [[infusion pump]]s of today.&lt;ref name=Major1966/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dragon1967/&gt;&lt;ref name=Firn1972/&gt;&lt;ref name=Josephson1974/&gt; The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the [[Penthrox inhaler]].&lt;ref name=Babl2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Grindlay2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Babl2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=McLennan2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Penthrox2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=RADAR2010/&gt;

'''Acute severe asthma,''' also known as '''status asthmaticus''', is an [[Acute (medical)|acute]] exacerbation of [[asthma]] that does not respond to standard treatments of [[bronchodilators]] (inhalers) and [[corticosteroid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ocean/aap/2012/00000033/a00103s1/art00016;jsessionid=5qo1cipdtq7kk.x-ic-live-01|title=Chapter 14: Acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus)|last1=Shah|first1=Rachna|last2=Saltoun|first2=Carol A.|date=May–June 2012|journal=Allergy and Asthma Proceedings|volume=33 Suppl 1|issue=3|pages=47–50|doi=10.2500/aap.2012.33.3547|pmid=22794687|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asthma is caused by multiple [[gene]]s, some having protective effect, with each gene having its own tendency to be influenced by the environment although a genetic link leading to acute severe asthma is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/asthma/ | title= Asthma | website= The Lecturio Medical Concept Library | date= 25 November 2020 |access-date= 1 July 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include chest tightness, rapidly progressive [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), dry [[cough]], use of accessory [[Muscles of respiration|respiratory muscles]], fast and/or labored breathing, and extreme [[Wheeze|wheezing]]. It is a life-threatening episode of airway obstruction and is considered a medical emergency. Complications include cardiac and/or respiratory arrest. The increasing prevalence of [[atopy]] and asthma remains unexplained but may be due to infection with respiratory viruses.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cheung|first1=Dorothy S.|last2=Ehlenbach|first2=Sarah J.|last3=Kitchens|first3=Robert T.|last4=Riley|first4=Desiré A.|last5=Thomas|first5=Larry L.|last6=Holtzman|first6=Michael J.|last7=Grayson|first7=Mitchell H.|date=2010-11-01|title=CD49d+ neutrophils induce FcεRI expression on lung dendritic cells in a mouse model of postviral asthma|journal=Journal of Immunology|volume=185|issue=9|pages=4983–4987|doi=10.4049/jimmunol.1002456|issn=0022-1767|pmc=2959147|pmid=20876348}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{TOC limit}}

==Signs and symptoms==
An exacerbation (attack) of asthma is experienced as a worsening of asthma symptoms with breathlessness and cough (often worse at night). In acute severe asthma, breathlessness may be so severe that it is impossible to speak more than a few words (inability to complete sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Kumar|first=Varun|date=2020-10-15|title=Asthma|url=https://www.getbibo.com/asthma/|access-date=2020-11-04|website=Bibo|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BTS&gt;{{cite web | series=Clinical guideline: asthma | url=https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/clinical-information/asthma/btssign-asthma-guideline-2014/ | title=SIGN 141 • British guideline on the management of asthma | publisher=British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (BTS/SIGN) | location=London | date=October 2014 | access-date=19 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912123433/https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/document-library/clinical-information/asthma/btssign-asthma-guideline-2014/ | archive-date=12 September 2017 | url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On examination, the [[tachypnoea|respiratory rate may be elevated]] (more than 25 breaths per minute), and the [[tachycardia|heart rate may be rapid]] (110 beats per minute or faster). Reduced oxygen saturation levels (but above 92%) are often encountered. Examination of the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal reduced air entry and/or widespread wheeze.&lt;ref name=BTS/&gt; The [[peak expiratory flow]] can be measured at the bedside; in acute severe asthma, the flow is less than 50% of a person's normal or predicted flow.&lt;ref name=BTS/&gt;

Very severe acute asthma (termed "near-fatal" as there is an immediate risk to life) is characterised by a peak flow of less than 33% predicted, oxygen saturations below 92% or [[cyanosis]] (blue discoloration, usually of the lips), absence of audible breath sounds over the chest ("silent chest" : wheezing is not heard because there is not enough air movement to generate it), reduced respiratory effort and visible exhaustion or drowsiness. Irregularities in the heartbeat and [[hypotension|abnormal lowering of the blood pressure]] may be observed.&lt;ref name=BTS/&gt;

Severe asthma attack can cause symptoms such as:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[Shortness of breath]]
* Inability to speak in full sentences
* Feeling [[Shortness of breath|breathless]] even when lying down
* Chest feels tight
* Bluish tint to the lips
* Hunched shoulders, and [[Strain (injury)|strained muscles]] in stomach and neck
* Feeling the need to sit or stand up to breathe more easily

== Cause ==
The cause for acute severe asthma attacks is still unknown and experts are also unsure of why it developed and why it does not respond to typical asthma treatments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.webmd.com/asthma/guide/status-asthmaticus|title=Status Asthmaticus (Severe Acute Asthma)|website=WebMD|language=en|access-date=2019-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{medical citation needed|date=July 2023}}
* Not seeing a doctor regularly, therefore asthma is not under good control
* Coming in contact with asthma [[Asthma trigger|triggers]]
* [[Allergy|Allergies]] or severe allergic reactions
* Not using the [[Peak expiratory flow|peak flow meter]] and not taking asthma medication as directed by a [[primary care physician]] (PCP) correctly
* Not following an asthma action plan correctly
* Respiratory infections
* Severe stress
* [[Cold|Cold weather]]
* [[Air pollution]]
* Exposure to chemicals and other irritants
* [[Smoking]]

== Mechanism ==
Inflammation in asthma is characterized by an influx of [[eosinophil]]s during the early-phase reaction and a mixed cellular infiltrate composed of eosinophils, [[mast cell]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, and [[neutrophil]]s during the late-phase (or chronic) reaction. The simple explanation for allergic inflammation in asthma begins with the development of a predominantly helper T2 [[lymphocyte]]–driven, as opposed to helper T1 [[lymphocyte]]–driven, immune milieu, perhaps caused by certain types of immune stimulation early in life. This is followed by allergen exposure in a genetically susceptible individual.

Specific allergen exposure (e.g., [[dust mite]]s) under the influence of helper [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 model|T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;2 helper T cells]] leads to [[B-lymphocyte]] elaboration of [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) antibodies specific to that allergen. The IgE antibody attaches to surface receptors on the airway [[Mucous membrane|mucosal]] [[mast cell]]s. One important question is whether [[Atopy|atopic]] individuals with asthma, in contrast to atopic persons without asthma, have a defect in mucosal integrity that makes them susceptible to penetration of allergens into the mucosa.

Subsequent specific allergen exposure leads to cross-bridging of [[Immunoglobulin E|IgE]] molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and release of a vast array of mediators. These mediators include [[histamine]]; [[leukotriene]]s C4, D4, and E4; and a host of [[cytokine]]s. Together, these mediators cause bronchial smooth muscle constriction, vascular leakage, inflammatory cell recruitment (with further mediator release), and mucous gland secretion. These processes lead to airway obstruction by constriction of the [[smooth muscle]]s, edema of the airways, influx of inflammatory cells, and formation of intraluminal mucus. In addition, ongoing airway inflammation is thought to cause airway hyperreactivity characteristic of asthma. The more severe the airway obstruction, the more likely ventilation-perfusion mismatching will result in impaired gas exchange and [[Hypoxemia|low levels of oxygen in the blood]].

==Diagnosis==
Severe acute asthma can be diagnosed by a primary care physician (PCP). A [[Primary care physician|PCP]] will ask questions in regards to symptoms and breathing; they will also ask if fatigue or wheezing has been experienced when breathing in or out; and also test using a peak expiratory flow and an oxygen saturation.

Status [[asthma]]ticus can be misdiagnosed when wheezing occurs from an acute cause other than asthma. Some of these alternative causes of wheezing are discussed below.

=== Extrinsic compression ===
Airways can be compressed from vascular structures, such as vascular rings, lymphadenopathy, or tumors.

=== [[Heart failure|Congestive heart failure]] ===
Airway edema may cause wheezing in CHF. In addition, vascular compression may compress the airways during systole with cardiac ejection, resulting in a pulsatile wheeze that corresponds to the heart rate. This is sometimes erroneously referred to as [[cardiac asthma]].

=== Differential diagnoses ===
* [[Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]]
* [[Aspiration pneumonia|Aspiration syndromes]]
* [[Bronchiectasis]]
* [[Bronchiolitis]]
* [[Obliterative bronchiolitis|Bronchiolitis obliterans]]
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|Chronic bronchitis]]
* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD)
* [[Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] (Churg–Strauss syndrome)
* [[Croup]]
* [[Cystic fibrosis]]
* Emphysema
* Foreign bodies of the airway
* [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease]]
* [[Heart failure]]
* Idiopathic pulmonary arterial [[hypertension]]
* Inhalation injury
* [[Pulmonary artery]] sling
* [[Vocal cords|Vocal cord]] dysfunction

==Treatment==
Interventions include [[intravenous]] (IV) medications (e.g. [[magnesium sulfate]]), aerosolized medications to dilate the airways (bronchodilation) (e.g., [[albuterol]] or [[ipratropium bromide/salbutamol]]), and [[positive-pressure]] therapy, including [[mechanical ventilation]]. Multiple therapies may be used simultaneously to rapidly reverse the effects of status asthmaticus and reduce permanent damage of the airways. Intravenous [[corticosteroid]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ratto|first1=David|last2=Alfaro|first2=Carlos|last3=Sipsey|first3=Jeff|last4=Glovsky|first4=M. Michael|last5=Sharma|first5=Om P.|date=1988-07-22|title=Are Intravenous Corticosteroids Required in Status Asthmaticus?|journal=JAMA|language=en|volume=260|issue=4|pages=527–529|doi=10.1001/jama.1988.03410040099036|pmid=3385910|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[methylxanthine]]s are often given. If the person with a severe asthma exacerbation is on a mechanical ventilator, certain sedating medications such as [[ketamine]] or [[propofol]], have bronchodilating properties. According to a new randomized control trial [[ketamine]] and [[aminophylline]] are also effective in children with acute asthma who responds poorly to standard therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jat|first1=KanaRam|last2=Tiwari|first2=Abhimanyu|last3=Guglani|first3=Vishal|date=2016|title=Ketamine versus aminophylline for acute asthma in children: A randomized, controlled trial|journal=Annals of Thoracic Medicine|volume=11|issue=4|pages=283–288|doi=10.4103/1817-1737.191874|pmid=27803755|pmc=5070438|issn=1817-1737 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent research ==
A recent study proposed that the interaction between host airway [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] and respiratory viruses is another aspect of innate immunity that is also a critical determination of [[asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Holtzman|first1=Michael J.|last2=Patel|first2=Dhara|last3=Zhang|first3=Yong|last4=Patel|first4=Anand C.|date=August 2011|title=Host epithelial-viral interactions as cause and cure for asthma|journal=Current Opinion in Immunology|volume=23|issue=4|pages=487–494|doi=10.1016/j.coi.2011.05.010|issn=0952-7915|pmc=3163712|pmid=21703838}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also proposed that a rationale for how antiviral performance at the epithelial cell level might be improved to prevent acute infectious illness and chronic inflammatory disease caused by respiratory viruses.

Another study aimed to show that experimental [[asthma]] after viral infection inmate depended on Type I [[Interferon gamma|IFN]]-driven up-regulation of the high-affinity receptor for IgE ([[FCER1|FcεRI]]) on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the lungs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The study found that a Novell PMN-cDc interaction in the lung is necessary for a viral infection to induce atopic disease.

==Epidemiology==
Status asthmaticus is slightly more common in males and is more common among people of African and Hispanic origin. The gene locus [[glutathione dependent S-nitrosoglutathione]] (GSNOR) has been suggested as one possible correlation to development of status asthmaticus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore PE, Ryckman KK, Williams SM, Patel N, Summar ML, Sheller JR |title=Genetic variants of GSNOR and ADRB2 influence response to albuterol in African-American children with severe asthma.|journal=Pediatric Pulmonology|date=9 July 2009|volume=44|issue=7|pages=649–654|pmid=19514054|doi=10.1002/ppul.21033|s2cid=30530302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease''' ('''AERD'''), also called '''NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease''' ('''N-ERD''') or historically '''aspirin-induced asthma''' and '''Samter's Triad,''' is a chronic respiratory disease defined by the simultaneous presence of three factors: [[asthma]], [[Sinusitis#Chronic|chronic rhinosinusitis]] with [[Nasal polyp|nasal polyps]], and intolerance of [[aspirin]] and other [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs).&lt;ref name="pmid24117484"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |vauthors=Kowalski ML, Asero R, Bavbek S, Blanca M, Blanca-Lopez N, Bochenek G, Brockow K, Campo P, Celik G, Cernadas J, Cortellini G, Gomes E, Niżankowska-Mogilnicka E, Romano A, Szczeklik A, Testi S, Torres MJ, Wöhrl S, Makowska J |date=October 2013 |title=Classification and practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs |journal=Allergy |volume=68 |issue=10 |pages=1219–1232 |doi=10.1111/all.12260 |pmid=24117484 |s2cid=32169451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy_2016" /&gt; In general, the nasal polyps are more recalcitrant and the asthma more severe than that of aspirin-tolerant patients. Reduction or loss of the ability to smell ([[hyposmia]], [[anosmia]]) is extremely common, occurring in greater than 90% of AERD patients.&lt;ref name="Haque_2021" /&gt; AERD most commonly begins in early- to mid-adulthood and has no known cure. While NSAID intolerance is a defining feature of AERD, avoidance of NSAIDs does not prevent the onset, development or perennial nature of the disease.&lt;ref name="pmid31235242"&gt;{{cite journal |display-authors=6 |vauthors=Taniguchi M, Mitsui C, Hayashi H, Ono E, Kajiwara K, Mita H, Watai K, Kamide Y, Fukutomi Y, Sekiya K, Higashi N |date=July 2019 |title=Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD): Current understanding of AERD |journal=Allergology International |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=289–295 |doi=10.1016/j.alit.2019.05.001 |pmid=31235242 |s2cid=195356657 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of the disease is a dysregulation of the [[arachidonic acid]] metabolic pathway and of various [[Nonspecific immune cell|innate immune cells]], though the initial cause of this dysregulation is currently unknown. This dysregulation leads to an imbalance of immune related molecules, including an overproduction of inflammatory compounds such as [[Leukotriene E4|leukotriene E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and an underproduction of anti-inflammatory mediators such as [[Prostaglandin E2|prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. This imbalance, among other factors, leads to chronic inflammation of the [[respiratory tract]].&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;

A history of respiratory reactions to aspirin or others NSAIDs is sufficient to diagnose AERD in a patient that has both asthma and nasal polyps. However, diagnosis can be challenging during disease onset, as symptoms do not usually begin all at once. As symptoms appear, AERD may be misdiagnosed as simple [[Allergic rhinitis|allergic]] or [[nonallergic rhinitis]] or adult-onset asthma alone. It is only once the [[List of medical triads, tetrads, and pentads|triad]] of symptoms are present that the diagnosis of AERD can be made.&lt;ref name="Haque_2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Brien EK, Jerschow E, Divekar RD | title = Management of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease: What Does the Future Hold? | journal = Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America | date = October 2023 | pmid = 37833102 | doi = 10.1016/j.otc.2023.09.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As there is no cure, treatment of AERD revolves around managing the symptoms of the disease. [[Corticosteroid|Corticosteroids]], surgery, diet modifications and [[monoclonal antibody]]-based drugs are all commonly used, among other treatment options. Paradoxically, daily aspirin therapy after an initial desensitization can also help manage symptoms.

Reactions to aspirin and other NSAIDs range in severity but almost always have a respiratory component; severe reactions can be life threatening. The symptoms of NSAID-induced reactions are [[Hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity reactions]] rather than [[allergic reactions]] that trigger other [[allergen]]-induced asthma, rhinitis, or hives. AERD is not considered an [[autoimmune disease]], but rather a chronic [[immune dysregulation]].&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eid_2021"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eid R, Yan CH, Stevens W, Doherty TA, Borish L | title = Innate immune cell dysregulation drives inflammation and disease in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | language = English | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 148 | issue = 2 | pages = 309–318 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34364539 | pmc = 8363117 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2021.06.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EAACI/WHO classifies the syndrome as one of five types of [[NSAID hypersensitivity reactions|NSAID hypersensitivity]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
AERD affects an estimated 0.3–0.9% of the general population in the US, including around 7% of all asthmatics, about 14% of adults with severe asthma, and ~5-10% of patients with adult onset asthma.&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;&lt;ref name= pmid30884882/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25282015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajan JP, Wineinger NE, Stevenson DD, White AA | title = Prevalence of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease among asthmatic patients: A meta-analysis of the literature | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 135 | issue = 3 | pages = 676–81.e1 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25282015 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2014.08.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AERD is uncommon among children, with around 6% of patients, predominantly female, reporting disease onset during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bensko JC, McGill A, Palumbo M, Cahill KN, Laidlaw TM | title = Pediatric-onset aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease: Clinical characteristics, prevalence, and response to dupilumab | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

While AERD has been found to affect essentially all ethnicities, it is less common in parts of Asia where nasal polyps caused by [[type 2 inflammation]] are relatively more rare.&lt;ref name="Haque_2021" /&gt;

While disease progression varies, most commonly the first symptom is [[rhinitis]] (inflammation or irritation of the nasal mucosa), which may manifest as sneezing, runny nose, or congestion. The disorder typically progresses to asthma, then nasal polyposis, with aspirin sensitivity coming last. [[Hyposmia]] or [[anosmia]]—reduction or loss of the ability to smell—are reported in more than 90% of patients, as inflammation within the nose and sinuses likely reaches the olfactory receptors.&lt;ref name="Haque_2021" /&gt;

Reactions to NSAIDs range in severity and expression. Onset is usually relatively rapid, with a mean time of around one hour after ingestion, though reactions as late as three hours have been reported. Respiratory reactions are essentially universal, with [[bronchoconstriction]] occurring in close to 90% of patients and nasal congestion and [[rhinorrhea]] occurring in more than 40%. Other symptoms include [[Hives|urticaria]] (hives), flushing, [[angioedema]] and [[hypotension]]. Gastrointestinal reactions have also been reported in a subset of patients, and may be difficult to treat. Factors that affect reaction severity include NSAID dosage, underlying asthma control, leukotriene modifier usage and the state of the patient's nasal polyps.&lt;ref name="Haque_2021" /&gt;

In addition to aspirin, patients also react to other NSAIDs such as [[ibuprofen]], and to any medication that inhibits the cyclooxygenase-1 ([[PTGS1|COX-1]]) enzyme, although [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) in low doses is generally considered safe. Selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]] NSAIDs that do not block COX-1, such as the [[celecoxib]] and [[rofecoxib]], also are regarded as safe.&lt;ref name="Haque_2021"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haque R, White AA, Jackson DJ, Hopkins C | title = Clinical evaluation and diagnosis of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 148 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–291 | date = August 2021 | pmid = 34364538 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2021.06.018 | s2cid = 236958386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, recent studies do find that these types of drugs, e.g. acetaminophen and celecoxib, may trigger adverse reactions in these patients; caution is recommended in using any COX inhibitors.&lt;ref name=pmid24587953&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YJ, Lim KH, Kim MY, Jo EJ, Lee SY, Lee SE, Yang MS, Song WJ, Kang HR, Park HW, Chang YS, Cho SH, Min KU, Kim SH | display-authors = 6 | title = Cross-reactivity to Acetaminophen and Celecoxib According to the Type of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug Hypersensitivity | journal = Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology Research | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–162 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24587953 | pmc = 3936045 | doi = 10.4168/aair.2014.6.2.156 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to aspirin and NSAIDs, consumption of even small amounts of alcohol also produces uncomfortable respiratory reactions in many patients.&lt;ref name=pmid24607050&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cardet JC, White AA, Barrett NA, Feldweg AM, Wickner PG, Savage J, Bhattacharyya N, Laidlaw TM | display-authors = 6 | title = Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms are common in patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

== Causes and Pathophysiology ==
The reason for onset of AERD is currently unknown. Allergic reaction to the [[superantigen]] of [[Staphylococcus aureus]], chronic viral infection and autoimmune mechanisms have been theorized, among others, though there is not sufficient evidence to support any specific theory. No strong genetic predisposition to or basis of AERD has been found, and familial AERD is rare. In addition, there is no relationship between past use of NSAIDs and onset of AERD&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;

AERD is generally thought to have two major components contributing to disease pathogenesis: abnormalities in the [[arachidonic acid]] metabolic cascade and dysregulation of various innate immune cells. These two components feed into each other in a highly complex negative cycle of increasing inflammation and dysregulation that is still under active research.&lt;ref name="Eid_2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sehanobish_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sehanobish E, Asad M, Jerschow E | title = New concepts for the pathogenesis and management of aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–48 | date = February 2022 | pmid = 34739410 | pmc = 8702488 | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arachidonic acid cascade dysregulation ===
AERD is associated with an aberrant arachidonic acid metabolism that leads to changes in levels of two major classes of [[Eicosanoid|eicosanoids]], specifically certain [[Leukotriene#Cysteinyl leukotrienes|cysteinyl leukotriene]]s (cysLTs) and [[Prostaglandin|prostaglandins]]. Notably, reduced [[Prostaglandin E2|prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) decreases inhibition of [[Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase|5-lipoxygenase]] (5-LO), causing increased conversion of arachidonic acid into [[Leukotriene A4|leukotriene A]][[Prostaglandin E2|4]] (LTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). LTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is converted into [[Leukotriene C4|leukotriene C{{Sub|4}}]] (LTC{{Sub|4}}), which itself is converted into [[Leukotriene D4|leukotriene D{{Sub|4}}]] (LTD{{Sub|4}}) and [[leukotriene E4|leukotriene E{{Sub|4}}]] (LTE{{Sub|4}}), both powerful bronchoconstrictors. In contrast to PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, AERD patients show significantly higher levels of [[Prostaglandin D2|prostaglandin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which exerts pro-inflammatory effects via its recruitment of [[Eosinophil|eosinophils]] and [[T helper cell|type 2 helper T cells]] (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2) cells in addition to its direct bronchoconstrictive action.&lt;ref name="Sehanobish_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23246457"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Narayanankutty A, Reséndiz-Hernández JM, Falfán-Valencia R, Teran LM |date=May 2013 |title=Biochemical pathogenesis of aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) |journal=Clinical Biochemistry |volume=46 |issue=7–8 |pages=566–578 |doi=10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2012.12.005 |pmid=23246457}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arachidonic Acid Cascade Simplified.svg|alt=Flow diagram with arrows pointing from arachidonic acid to the eicosanoid products produced, including leukotrienes and prostaglandins|thumb|400x400px|Simplified overview of the arachidonic acid metabolic cascade and some of its relevant downstream products]]
The exact mechanism by which aspirin and other [[PTGS1|COX-1]] inhibitors lead to acute respiratory reactions is still under investigation. AERD patients exhibit a seemingly paradoxical response to COX-1 inhibition, as it leads to greatly increased PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LTE{{Sub|4}} levels, instead of the expected decrease in PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and relative lack of change in LTE{{Sub|4}}. However, given that COX-1 catalyzes the formation of PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a leading explanation is that patients have an increased dependence on PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and its [[Prostaglandin EP2 receptor|corresponding receptor]] (EP2) to prevent inflammatory mediator release from [[Mast cell|mast cells]]. When COX-1 is inhibited, the decreased PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production leads to mast cell [[degranulation]] and release of LTC{{Sub|4}} and PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which leads to respiratory symptom exacerbation.&lt;ref name="Sehanobish_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullol_2021"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mullol J, Boyce J, Dahlén SE, Dahlén B, Picado C, Bobolea I | title = Eicosanoid dysregulation and type 2 inflammation in AERD | language = English | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 148 | issue = 5 | pages = 1157–1160 | date = November 2021 | pmid = 34464635 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2021.08.015 | s2cid = 237374571 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients with AERD also show increased expression of [[Leukotriene C4 synthase|leukotriene C{{Sub|4}} synthase]] (LTC{{Sub|4}}S), which converts LTA&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; into LTC{{Sub|4}}. [[Platelet|Platelets]], which express  LTC{{Sub|4}}S and generate LTC{{Sub|4}} when attached to 5-LO-expressing [[White blood cell|leukocytes]] (including eosinophils), are also implicated in disease pathogenesis as well as acute aspirin-induced exacerbations. Additionally, after aspirin or other NSAID exposure, AERD patients generally become desensitized and tolerate a second exposure for around one week, which lines up with the half life of circulating platelets.&lt;ref name="pmid23246457" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullol_2021" /&gt;

Additional downstream products of arachidonic acid such as [[ALOX15|15-lipoxygenase]] (15-LO) produced [[15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid|15-HETE]] and 15-Oxo-ETE are significantly elevated in nasal polyps from AERD patients while other products like anti-inflammatory [[Lipoxin|lipoxins]] are reduced. It's possible that increased 15-LO activity and preferential conversion of arachidonic acid into 15-Oxo-ETE and [[Eoxin|eoxins]] over lipoxins contributes to inflammation in AERD.&lt;ref name="Sehanobish_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyly_2021"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lyly A, Laidlaw TM, Lundberg M | title = Pathomechanisms of AERD-Recent Advances | journal = Frontiers in Allergy | volume = 2 | pages = 734733 | date = 2021 | pmid = 35387030 | pmc = 8974777 | doi = 10.3389/falgy.2021.734733 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innate immune cells ===
Various innate immune cells also appear to play important roles in AERD pathogenesis. Eosinophils, mast cells, [[Basophil|basophils]] and [[ILC2|type 2 innate lymphoid]] (ILC2) cells have all been found at increased levels in the nasal polyps of AERD patients and appear to be part of the negative cycle of inflammation in AERD.&lt;ref name="Eid_2021" /&gt;

[[File:AERD Innate Immune Cells.svg|alt=A diagram of some of the interactions between immune cells and their products, as relevant to AERD disease pathophysiology|thumb|400x400px|An overview of some of the immune cells and molecules involved in the negative cycle of disease in AERD]]
ILC2 cells are activated by CysLTs and PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in addition to a class of [[Cytokine|cytokines]] called [[Damage-associated molecular pattern|alarmins]] that are released by [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]], including [[Interleukin 25|IL-25]], [[Interleukin 33|IL-33]] and [[thymic stromal lymphopoietin]] (TSLP). Strongly activated ILC2s release [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[Interleukin 5|IL-5]] and [[Interleukin 13|IL-13]]. These cytokines lead to increased eosinophil recruitment, excessive mucus production via [[Goblet cell|goblet cells]], and promotion of T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 and immunoglobulin E responses. These responses cause the epithelial cells to release more cytokines and inflammatory molecules, creating a feed-forward negative cycle of increasing inflammation.&lt;ref name="Eid_2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullol_2021" /&gt;

Eosinophils are also activated by ILC2-released IL-5 and epithelial-cell released IL-33, causing them to release more CysLTs and PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which in turn further active ILC2. Likewise, mast cells are also activated by epithelial-cell released IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, leading to further CysLT and PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;ref name="Eid_2021" /&gt;

Basophils, which are degranulated in AERD nasal polyps, also appear to be important sources of IL-4 and IL-13.&lt;ref name="Eid_2021" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sehanobish_2022" /&gt; In addition to activating immune cells, IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to significantly increase 15-LO activity, further playing into the cycle of dysregulation and disease.&lt;ref name="Lyly_2021" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of AERD can be difficult, as symptoms develop over time and can often be attributed to allergies, common asthma, and/or [[nonallergic rhinitis]]. AERD is generally diagnosed based on a patient's medical history, however an oral aspirin challenge at a specialized facility is considered the most definitive method of diagnosis.&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;

Patients are considered candidates for an AERD diagnosis if they meet the following three points:

* History of adverse reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs
* Reduced ability to smell (hyposmia or anosmia)
* History of rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps

Further, if a patient meets two or more of the following criteria, then an AERD diagnosis is strongly considered:&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;

* Moderate or severe asthma
* Asthma with an intractable cough
* Onset of asthma after adolescence
* A weakly [[Atopy|atopic]] disposition
* 10% or greater increase in peripheral [[eosinophilia]]

High urinary [[leukotriene E4|leukotriene E{{Sub|4}}]] (uLTE{{Sub|4}}) concentration is also a sign of AERD, especially when noted in conjunction with the criteria listed above due. High uLTE{{Sub|4}} concentration alone cannot be used to diagnose AERD, however it may be possible to rule out AERD in patients without high uLTE{{Sub|4}} due to its strong [[Positive and negative predictive values#Negative predictive value (NPV)|negative predictive value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bochenek G, Stachura T, Szafraniec K, Plutecka H, Sanak M, Nizankowska-Mogilnicka E, Sladek K | title = Diagnostic Accuracy of Urinary LTE4 Measurement to Predict Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease in Patients with Asthma | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 528–535 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28888846 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2017.07.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Urinary LTE{{Sub|4}} concentration is generally around 3 to 5 times higher in patients with AERD that it is in those with aspirin-tolerant asthma, and increases 2 to 30 fold during an aspirin challenge test.&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;

== Management ==

=== Medication ===

Since nasal polyps have been identified as an important source of inflammatory compounds in AERD, much effort goes into the prevention of polyp growth and control of sinus symptoms in general. There is evidence supporting four different long-term pharmacological treatments to this end: intra-nasal [[Corticosteroid|corticosteroids]], aspirin [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitization]] and therapy, a range of [[Biopharmaceutical|biologic medicines]], and [[Antileukotriene|antileukotrienes]].&lt;ref name="Kim_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim SL, Rank MA, Peters AT | title = The chronic rhinosinusitis practice parameter | journal = Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology | pages = 307–310 | date = December 2022 | volume = 131 | issue = 3 | pmid = 36538974 | doi = 10.1016/j.anai.2022.12.022 | s2cid = 254849277 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wentzel_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wentzel JL, Soler ZM, DeYoung K, Nguyen SA, Lohia S, Schlosser RJ | title = Leukotriene antagonists in nasal polyposis: a meta-analysis and systematic review | journal = American Journal of Rhinology &amp; Allergy | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 482–489 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24274224 | pmc = 3899527 | doi = 10.2500/ajra.2013.27.3976 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each treatment has benefits and drawbacks, so no one option can be recommended for all patients. Asthma symptoms, if not controlled via biologics or other means, are managed with standard asthma treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids and [[Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist|long-acting beta-agonists]].&lt;ref name="pmid31235242" /&gt;

Despite optimal medical management, many patients continue to require oral steroid medications to alleviate asthma and chronic nasal congestion.&lt;ref name="pmid11028656"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szczeklik A, Nizankowska E, Duplaga M |date=September 2000 |title=Natural history of aspirin-induced asthma.

==== Intra-nasal corticosteroids ====
Common corticosteroids such as [[fluticasone]] or [[budesonide]] are often used as a first line treatment for AERD. They can be delivered topically to the nasal and sinus mucosa via a variety of methods, such as nasal spray, rinse, drops, stents and [[Exhalation delivery system|exhalation delivery systems]]. Overall effectiveness is low-to-moderate, but wide availability and low cost make this a widely used treatment option.&lt;ref name="Kim_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bognanni_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bognanni A, Chu DK, Rank MA, Bernstein J, Ellis AK, Golden D, Greenhawt M, Hagan JB, Horner CC, Ledford DK, Lieberman J, Luong AU, Marks LA, Orlandi RR, Samant SA, Shaker M, Soler ZM, Stevens WW, Stukus DR, Wang J, Peters AT | display-authors = 6 | title = Topical corticosteroids for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis: GRADE systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 150 | issue = 6 | pages = 1447–1459 | date = December 2022 | pmid = 35970310 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2022.07.023 | s2cid = 251547875 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stent, spray and exhalation delivery systems are generally among the most beneficial depending on outcome measured, while no major differences in adverse effects have been measured between delivery methods.&lt;ref name="Kim_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bognanni_2022" /&gt;

==== Aspirin desensitization and therapy ====
Avoidance of NSAID medications will not stop the progression of the disease. However, one treatment option is desensitization to aspirin, undertaken at a clinic or hospital specializing in such treatment.&lt;ref name="Waldram_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Waldram JD, Simon RA | title = Performing Aspirin Desensitization in Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease | journal = Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America | volume = 36 | issue = 4 | pages = 693–703 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27712764 | doi = 10.1016/j.iac.2016.06.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who are desensitized then take a maintenance dose of aspirin daily to maintain their desensitization. The recommended maintenance dose for symptom control is 650&amp;nbsp;mg to 1300&amp;nbsp;mg aspirin daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JY, Simon RA, Stevenson DD | title = Selection of aspirin dosages for aspirin desensitization treatment in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 119 | issue = 1 | pages = 157–164 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17208597 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2006.09.011 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; While on daily aspirin, patients experience improved quality of life and reduced nasal symptoms, however, there is no improvement in smell compared to placebo and there is no reduction in the need for oral corticosteroids or rescue surgery.&lt;ref name="Oykhman_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oykhman P, Paramo FA, Bousquet J, Kennedy DW, Brignardello-Petersen R, Chu DK | title = Comparative efficacy and safety of monoclonal antibodies and aspirin desensitization for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis: A systematic review and network meta-analysis | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 149 | issue = 4 | pages = 1286–1295 | date = April 2022 | pmid = 34543652 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2021.09.009 | s2cid = 237584489 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim_2022" /&gt; Once desensitized to aspirin, most patients can safely take other NSAID medications again as long the daily maintenance dose is continued.&lt;ref name="pmid7054250"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pleskow WW, Stevenson DD, Mathison DA, Simon RA, Schatz M, Zeiger RS | title = Aspirin desensitization in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients: clinical manifestations and characterization of the refractory period | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 69 | issue = 1 Pt 1 | pages = 11–19 | date = January 1982 | pmid = 7054250 | doi = 10.1016/0091-6749(82)90081-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk of adverse advents such as bleeding or gastrointestinal side effects is relatively high with daily aspirin therapy. Even a 81&amp;nbsp;mg daily aspirin regimen for cardiovascular benefits has been shown to increase risk of long-term bleeding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davidson KW, Barry MJ, Mangione CM, Cabana M, Chelmow D, Coker TR, Davis EM, Donahue KE, Jaén CR, Krist AH, Kubik M, Li L, Ogedegbe G, Pbert L, Ruiz JM, Stevermer J, Tseng CW, Wong JB | display-authors = 6 | title = Aspirin Use to Prevent Cardiovascular Disease: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = JAMA | volume = 327 | issue = 16 | pages = 1577–1584 | date = April 2022 | pmid = 35471505 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2022.4983 | s2cid = 248390304 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the significantly higher aspirin doses used for maintenance therapy are of some concern.&lt;ref name="Kim_2022" /&gt; This is borne out in studies on AERD patients—compared against standard of care and biologic medicines, aspirin therapy has a significantly higher rate of adverse outcomes.&lt;ref name="Oykhman_2022" /&gt;

==== Biologics ====
Various novel biologic [[monoclonal antibody]] medications that have come to market in recent years have been used to treat AERD including [[dupilumab]], [[mepolizumab]], [[omalizumab]], and [[benralizumab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tuttle KL, Buchheit KM, Schneider T, Hsu Blatman KS, Barrett NA, Laidlaw TM, Cahill KN |date=February 2018 |title=A pragmatic analysis of mepolizumab in patients with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=AB168 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2017.12.537 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wangberg_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wangberg H, Spierling Bagsic SR, Osuna L, White AA | title = Appraisal of the Real-World Effectiveness of Biologic Therapies in Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 478–484.e3 | date = February 2022 | pmid = 34597850 | pmc = 8837666 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2021.09.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among treatment options, biologics have the highest certainty and magnitude of improvement effect. However, due to the high cost and systemic nature of biologics, some patients whose symptoms are sufficiently controlled with other treatments may prefer to avoid them or not qualify under stricter prescription guidelines.&lt;ref name="Kim_2022" /&gt;

Among biologics and aspirin desensitization and therapy, dupilumab (Dupixent) was show to be the most effective across six different patient-important outcomes.&lt;ref name="Wangberg_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oykhman_2022" /&gt; Dupilumab and omalizumab have been shown to increase aspirin tolerance in AERD patients, however mepolizumab does not appear to have this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mustafa SS, Vadamalai K | title = Dupilumab increases aspirin tolerance in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology | volume = 126 | issue = 6 | pages = 738–739 | date = June 2021 | pmid = 33746062 | doi = 10.1016/j.anai.2021.03.010 | s2cid = 232308870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Picado_2022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Picado C, Mullol J, Roca-Ferrer J | title = Mechanisms by which dupilumab normalizes eicosanoid metabolism and restores aspirin-tolerance in AERD: A hypothesis | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | pages = 310–313 | date = September 2022 | volume = 151 | issue = 2 | pmid = 36126795 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2022.09.012 | s2cid = 252363143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism through which dupilumab treats AERD and restores aspirin tolerance is not fully understood, but it is theorized that by blocking [[Interleukin-4 receptor|IL-4α]], dupilumab increases expression of EP2, the receptor for PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, back to normal levels, normalizing COX function and PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. Low PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and activity appear to play a key role in AERD, as PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; prevents inflammatory mediator release from mast cells and inhibits 5-LO function, which decreases production of CysLTs.&lt;ref name="Picado_2022" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buchheit KM, Sohail A, Hacker J, Maurer R, Gakpo D, Bensko JC, Taliaferro F, Ordovas-Montanes J, Laidlaw TM | display-authors = 6 | title = Rapid and sustained effect of dupilumab on clinical and mechanistic outcomes in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 150 | issue = 2 | pages = 415–424 | date = August 2022 | pmid = 35460728 | pmc = 9378638 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2022.04.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Antileukotrienes ====
[[Leukotriene|Leukotrienes]] are a family of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid that include CysLTs implicated in AERD pathophysiology. Drugs that prevent leukotriene production, such as [[zileuton]], and that block leukotriene receptors, such as [[montelukast]] and [[zafirlukast]], have proven to be useful in treatment of nasal polyposis. However, there may be limited additional benefit when used in conjunction with intra-nasal corticosteroids.&lt;ref name="Wentzel_2013" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Nicoló M, Habermann N, Havel M | title = AERD Associated Nasal Polyposis: Efficacy of Postoperative Antileukotriene Therapy in Comparison with Aspirin Desensitization. A Retrospective Study | journal = International Archives of Allergy and Immunology | volume = 181 | issue = 10 | pages = 790–798 | date = 2020 | pmid = 32777782 | doi = 10.1159/000508708 | s2cid = 221099029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a large survey, AERD patients reported that zileuton was more effective at controlling their symptoms than montelukast. Despite this, zileuton remains less prescribed than montelukast, likely due to concerns around risk of liver enzyme elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ta V, White AA | title = Survey-Defined Patient Experiences With Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 711–718 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 25858054 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2015.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surgery ===

Often [[functional endoscopic sinus surgery]] is required to remove nasal polyps,&lt;ref name=pmid17181095&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMains KC, Kountakis SE | title = Medical and surgical considerations in patients with Samter's triad | journal = American Journal of Rhinology | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 573–576 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17181095 | doi = 10.2500/ajr.2006.20.2913 | s2cid = 33480314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they typically recur, particularly if aspirin desensitization is not undertaken. Approximately, 90% of patients have been shown to have recurrence of nasal polyps within five years after surgery, with 47% requiring revision surgery in the same time period.&lt;ref name=pmid21510141&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendelsohn D, Jeremic G, Wright ED, Rotenberg BW | title = Revision rates after endoscopic sinus surgery: a recurrence analysis | journal = The Annals of Otology, Rhinology, and Laryngology | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | pages = 162–166 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 21510141 | doi = 10.1177/000348941112000304 | s2cid = 26696888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete endoscopic sinus surgery followed by aspirin desensitization has been shown to reduce the need for revision surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adappa ND, Ranasinghe VJ, Trope M, Brooks SG, Glicksman JT, Parasher AK, Palmer JN, Bosso JV | display-authors = 6 | title = Outcomes after complete endoscopic sinus surgery and aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = International Forum of Allergy &amp; Rhinology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–53 | date = January 2018 | pmid = 29105347 | doi = 10.1002/alr.22036 | s2cid = 5811563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact cause of nasal polyp formation is unknown, however, differential gene expression analysis of AERD nasal polyp epithelial cells versus AERD non polyp nasal mucosa revealed DMRT3 could be potentially involved in nasal polyp development in AERD patients. Furthermore, several genes are down-regulated, hinting at the de-differentiation phenomenon in AERD polyps.&lt;ref&gt;Priyadharshini, V.S.; Jiménez-Chobillon, M.A.; de Graaf, J.; Porras Gutiérrez de Velasco, R.; Gratziou, C.; Ramírez-Jiménez, F.; Teran, L.M.

=== Diet ===
==== Low omega-6/high omega-3 ====
Given that dysregulation of the arachidonic acid cascade has been implicated in AERD pathogenesis and that production of arachidonic acid and its downstream products is influenced by the [[Essential fatty acid interactions|interaction and metabolism]] of [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]] and [[Omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] essential fatty acids, dietary interventions targeting the two essential fatty acids are under study.

A diet low in omega-6 fatty acids and high in omega-3 fatty acids—the opposite of an average modern western diet—has been shown to reduce arachidonic acid precursors and increase [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA) and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA). EPA and DHA are precursors for anti-inflammatory compounds that modulate leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes that have been implicated in AERD pathogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Modena BD, White AA | title = Can Diet Modification Be an Effective Treatment in Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease? | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 832–833 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29747986 | pmc = 6455762 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2017.11.043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial studies have shown that decreasing omega-6 intake and increasing omega-3 intake decrease urinary LTE{{Sub|4}} and [[Prostaglandin D2|prostaglandin D{{Sub|2}}]] levels and significantly improved overall symptoms.&lt;ref name="Laidlaw_2019"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laidlaw TM | title = Clinical updates in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = Allergy and Asthma Proceedings | volume = 40 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–6 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30582489 | pmc = 6313255 | doi = 10.2500/aap.2019.40.4188 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29133219"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schneider TR, Johns CB, Palumbo ML, Murphy KC, Cahill KN, Laidlaw TM | title = Dietary Fatty Acid Modification for the Treatment of Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease: A Prospective Pilot Trial | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

==== Alcohol ====
The majority of those with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease experience respiratory reactions to alcohol. One study found that 83% reported such reactions. Of those who had reactions, 75% had a sinus reaction (runny nose, nasal congestion) and 51% had a lower respiratory reaction (wheezing, shortness of breath).&lt;ref name="pmid24607050" /&gt; The current theory on the cause of these reactions is that they may be related to polyphenols found in alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne SC | title = Re: Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms are common in patients with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 644 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25213072 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2014.05.003 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found that alcohol sensitive patients reacted to catechins in red wine, but not to resveratrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Payne SC, Peters RD, Negri JA, Steinke JW, Borish L | title = Activation of Basophils and Eosinophils by EtOH in Alcohol Sensitive Patients with CRS and Asthma| date = February 2017 | journal = Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 139| issue = 2| pages = AB90| doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2016.12.246| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that steel fermented white wines and clear liquors may cause less of a reaction than other alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aaaai.org/global/latest-research-summaries/New-Research-from-JACI-In-Practice/wine-beer-lung-sinuse |title= Wine and Beer May Make Your Lungs and Sinuses Worse |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website= www.aaaai.org |publisher= American Academy of Allergy Asthma &amp; Immunology |date= August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desensitization to aspirin has been found to reduce reactions to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ta V, White AA | title = Survey-Defined Patient Experiences With Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.

==== Dietary salicylates ====
Given that aspirin is a salicylate, specifically acetyl salicylic acid, research has gone into low-salicylate diets such as the [[Feingold diet]] to see if they benefit AERD patients. For example, a prospective randomized trial with 30 patients following a low-salicylate diet for six weeks demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in both subjective and objective scoring of severity of disease, but made note of the challenge for patients in following what is a fairly stringent diet.&lt;ref name="pmid26751262"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sommer DD, Rotenberg BW, Sowerby LJ, Lee JM, Janjua A, Witterick IJ, Monteiro E, Gupta MK, Au M, Nayan S | display-authors = 6 | title = A novel treatment adjunct for aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease: the low-salicylate diet: a multicenter randomized control crossover trial | journal = International Forum of Allergy &amp; Rhinology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–391 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26751262 | doi = 10.1002/alr.21678 | s2cid = 205339377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these findings, experts on the disease do not believe that dietary salicylates contribute to AERD symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid29747986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Modena BD, White AA | title = Can Diet Modification Be an Effective Treatment in Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease? | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. In Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 832–833 | year = 2018 | pmid = 29747986 | pmc = 6455762 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaip.2017.11.043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary salicylates do not significantly inhibit the COX-1 enzyme, which is the cause of AERD reactions. One confounding factor in the study that showed a benefit from avoidance of dietary salicylates is that a low salicylate diet involves eliminating wine and beer. The majority of AERD patients react to wine and beer for reasons that do not involve their salicylate content.&lt;ref name="pmid24607050" /&gt; There is also a strong placebo effect involved with any dietary intervention. In contrast to aspirin, dietary salicylates are not acetylated and therefore do not block [[cyclooxygenase]]s and hence, there is no rationale why a low salicylate diet would be beneficial for AERD patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Low Salicylate Diet for AERD (Samter's Triad) | url = https://www.samterssociety.org/low-salicylate-diet | work = The Samter's Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="4104" xml:space="preserve">The '''specific inhalation challenge''' ('''SIC''') is a diagnosis tool to assess airway responsiveness to "sensitizing" substances as opposed to nonspecific stimuli such as pharmacological agents (i.e. histamine, methacholine), cold air and exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vandenplas O, Malo JL |title=Inhalation challenges with agents causing occupational asthma |journal=Eur Respir J |volume=10 |issue=11 |pages=2612–29 |date=November 1997 |pmid=9426105 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9426105 |doi=10.1183/09031936.97.10112612|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects are exposed to a suspected occupational agent in a controlled way under close supervision in a hospital laboratory. The specific inhalation challenges has been considered as the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis of [[occupational asthma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cloutier Y, Lagier F, Cartier A, Malo JL |title=Validation of an exposure system to particles for the diagnosis of occupational asthma |journal=Chest |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=402–7 |date=August 1992 |pmid=1643922 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/abstract/102/2/402 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030905135550/http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/abstract/102/2/402 |url-status=dead|archive-date=2003-09-05 |doi=10.1378/chest.102.2.402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
One of the steps of SIC is to perform a challenge with the suspected [[asthmagen]]. Then, FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is subsequently measured using another device and compared to a baseline.
A positive response is usually a decrease in baseline FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of 15 to 20 percent.

=== Realistic method ===
The realistic method was developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=Chan&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chan-Yeung M |title=2003 Christie Memorial lecture. Occupational asthma--the past 50 years |journal=Can Respir J |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=21–6 |year=2004 |doi=10.1155/2004/861745 |pmid=15010728 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patient enters a sealed chamber and is exposed to the suspected agent in a controlled, non-work, test environment. The asthmagen can be water-soluble and nebulized. If the agent is non-soluble, the patient tips the agent from one tray to another in an attempt to mimic the work environment. This method has the advantage of being able to assess, albeit highly subjectively,	ocular and nasal symptoms as well as a reduction in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt;

There are, however, disadvantages to the method. First, SIC is currently only conducted in specialty facilities because the facilities and equipment are rare and expensive. Second, the realistic method may exposed the patient to huge concentrations of particles, resulting in unduly severe [[asthma]] attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Cloutier Y, Lagier F, Lemieux R, etal |title=New methodology for specific inhalation challenges with occupational agents in powder form |journal=Eur Respir J |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=769–77 |date=September 1989 |doi=10.1183/09031936.93.02080769 |pmid=2806499 |s2cid=54499155 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/8/769|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, the agent can be delivered using the recently developed closed-circuit technique.

=== Closed-circuit method === 
This test requires the patient to breathe aerosols of the suspected agent (asthmagen) through an oro-facial mask or mouth piece. These asthmagens are aerosolized using closed-circuit chambers, and the quantities and concentrations administered being minute and extremely stable minimize the risk of exaggerated responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Malo JL, Cartier A, Lemière C, etal |title=Exaggerated bronchoconstriction due to inhalation challenges with occupational agents |journal=Eur Respir J |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=300–3 |date=February 2004 |pmid=14979507  |url=http://www.erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/content/full/23/2/300 |doi=10.1183/09031936.03.00055003|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
===Types===
The 2005 ''[[Oxford Textbook of Medicine]]'' distinguishes type 1 brittle asthma by "persistent daily chaotic variability in peak flow (usually greater than 40 per cent diurnal variation in PEFR more than 50 per cent of the time)", while type 2 is identified by "sporadic sudden falls in PEFR against a background of usually well-controlled asthma with normal or near normal lung function".&lt;ref name=W1347&gt;Warrell, 1347.&lt;/ref&gt; In both types, patients are subject to recurrent, severe attacks. The cardinal symptoms of an asthma attack are shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), [[wheeze|wheezing]], and chest tightness.&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book | author = Saunders | chapter = Asthma | title = Mason: Murray &amp; Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine | editor = Homer A. Boushey Jr., M.D. | editor2 = David B. Corry, M.D. | editor3 = John V. Fahy, M.D. | editor4 = Esteban G. Burchard, M.D. | editor5 = Prescott G. Woodruff, M.D. | display-editors = etal | edition = 4th | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with type 1 suffer chronic attacks in spite of ongoing medical therapy, while those with type 2 experience sudden, acute and even potentially life-threatening attacks even though otherwise their asthma seems well managed.&lt;ref name=H292&gt;Holgate et al., 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

When first defined by [[Margaret Turner-Warwick]] in 1977, the term brittle asthma was used specifically to describe type 1, but as studies into the phenotype were conducted the second type was also distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Waldron | first = Jill | title = Asthma Care in the Community | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-470-03000-4 | page= 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
In addition to any issues of [[Compliance (medicine)|treatment compliance]], and maximised [[corticosteroid]]s (inhaled or oral) and [[beta agonist]],  brittle asthma treatment also involves for type 1 additional subcutaneous injections of beta2 agonist and inhalation of [[long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist]],&lt;ref name="pmid15636398"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Graziani E, Petroianni A, Terzano C |title=Brittle asthma |journal=Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=135–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15636398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  whilst type 2 needs allergen avoidance and self-management approaches.&lt;ref name="pmid17695694"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Toungoussova O, Foschino Barbaro MP, Esposito LM |title=Brittle asthma |journal=Monaldi Arch Chest Dis |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=102–5 |date=June 2007 |pmid=17695694 |doi= 10.4081/monaldi.2007.497|display-authors=etal|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since catastrophic attacks are unpredictable in type 2, patients may display identification of the issue, such as a [[MedicAlert]] bracelet, and carry an [[epinephrine autoinjector]].&lt;ref name=W1347/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The condition is rare. 1999's ''Difficult Asthma'' estimates a prevalence of approximately 0.05% brittle asthma sufferers among the asthmatic population.&lt;ref name=H293&gt;Holgate et al., 293.&lt;/ref&gt; Though found in all ages, it is most commonly found in individuals between the ages of 18 and 55; it is present in both sexes, though type 1 has been diagnosed in three times as many women as men.&lt;ref name=H293/&gt; Hospitalization is more frequent for type 1 than type 2.&lt;ref name=H293/&gt;

[[Asthma]] is a common pulmonary condition defined by chronic inflammation of respiratory tubes, tightening of respiratory smooth muscle, and episodes of bronchoconstriction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=Lan|last2=Diaz|first2=Philip T.|last3=Best|first3=Thomas M.|last4=Stimpfl|first4=Julia N.|last5=He|first5=Feng|last6=Zuo|first6=Li|title=Molecular characterization of redox mechanisms in allergic asthma|journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology|volume=113|issue=2|pages=137–142|doi=10.1016/j.anai.2014.05.030|pmid=24986036|year=2014}}{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 1 in 11 children and 1 in 12 adults have asthma in the United States of America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the World Health Organization, asthma affects 235 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ |title=Asthma |website=World Health Organization |language=en-GB |access-date=2016-03-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629035454/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major categories of asthma: allergic and non-allergic. The focus of this article will be allergic asthma. In both cases, bronchoconstriction is prominent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Bronchoconstriction==
[[File:Asthma before-after-en.svg|thumb|300px|Inflamed airways and bronchoconstriction in asthma results in airways narrowing and thus [[wheezing]].]]
[[Image:Asthma .jpg|thumb|Obstruction of the lumen of the bronchiole by mucoid exudate, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial basement membrane thickening and severe inflammation of bronchiole.]]
During an asthma episode, inflamed [[bronchiole|airways]] react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways narrow and produce excess [[mucus]], making it difficult to breathe.
In essence, asthma is the result of an [[immune system|immune response]] in the [[bronchiole|bronchial]] airways.&lt;ref name=Maddox&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maddox L, Schwartz DA |title=The pathophysiology of asthma |journal=Annu. Rev. Med. |volume=53 |pages=477–98 |year=2002 |pmid=11818486 |doi=10.1146/annurev.med.53.082901.103921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airways of asthma patients are "[[hypersensitivity|hypersensitive]]" to certain [[Asthma trigger|triggers]], also known as ''stimuli'' (see below). (It is usually classified as [[type I hypersensitivity]].)&lt;ref name="urlLecture 14: Hypersensitivity"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-immuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec13/lec13_97.html |title=Lecture 14: Hypersensitivity |access-date=2008-09-18 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721032615/http://www-immuno.path.cam.ac.uk/~immuno/part1/lec13/lec13_97.html | archive-date=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlAllergy &amp; Asthma Disease Management Center: Ask the Expert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaaai.org/aadmc/ate/category.asp?cat=1008 |title=Allergy &amp; Asthma Disease Management Center: Ask the Expert |access-date=2008-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216085147/http://www.aaaai.org/AADMC/ate/category.asp?cat=1008|archive-date=2007-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to exposure to these triggers, the [[bronchus|bronchi]] (large airways) contract into [[spasm]] (an "asthma attack"). [[Inflammation]] soon follows, leading to a further narrowing of the airways and excessive [[mucus]] production, which leads to coughing and other breathing difficulties. Bronchospasm may resolve spontaneously in 1–2 hours, or in about 50% of subjects, may become part of a 'late' response, where this initial insult is followed 3–12 hours later with further bronchoconstriction and inflammation.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray and Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 4th Ed. Robert J. Mason, John F. Murray, Jay A. Nadel, 2005, [[Elsevier]] pp. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal caliber of the bronchus is maintained by a balanced functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which both operate reflexively. The [[parasympathetic]] reflex loop consists of afferent nerve endings which originate under the inner lining of the bronchus. Whenever these afferent nerve endings are stimulated (for example, by dust, cold air or fumes) impulses travel to the brain-stem vagal center, then down the vagal efferent pathway to again reach the bronchial small airways. Acetylcholine is released from the efferent nerve endings. This acetylcholine results in the excessive formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in bronchial smooth muscle cells which leads to muscle shortening and this initiates bronchoconstriction.

==Bronchial inflammation==
[[File:2311 Lung Tissue.jpg|thumb|Normal and Bronchial Asthma Tissues (a) Normal lung tissue does not have the characteristics of lung tissue during (b) an asthma attack, which include thickened mucosa, increased mucus-producing goblet cells, and eosinophil infiltrates.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology attribution"&gt;{{CC-notice|cc=by4|url=https://openstax.org/books/anatomy-and-physiology/pages/22-1-organs-and-structures-of-the-respiratory-system}} {{cite book|last1=Betts|first1=J Gordon|last2=Desaix|first2=Peter|last3=Johnson|first3=Eddie|last4=Johnson|first4=Jody E|last5=Korol|first5=Oksana|last6=Kruse|first6=Dean|last7=Poe|first7=Brandon|last8=Wise|first8=James|last9=Womble|first9=Mark D|last10=Young|first10=Kelly A|title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology|location=Houston|publisher=OpenStax CNX|isbn=978-1-947172-04-3|date=September 13, 2023|at=22.1 Organs and structures of the respiratory system}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mechanisms behind allergic asthma—i.e., asthma resulting from an [[immune system|immune response]] to inhaled [[allergen]]s—are the best understood of the causal factors. In both people with asthma and people who are free of the disease, inhaled allergens that find their way to the inner [[bronchiole|airways]] are [[phagocytosis|ingested]] by a type of cell known as [[antigen-presenting cell]]s, or APCs. APCs then "present" pieces of the allergen to other [[immune system]] cells. In most people, these other immune cells ([[T helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;0 cells]]) "check" and usually ignore the allergen molecules. In asthma patients, however, these cells [[Cellular differentiation|transform]] into a different type of cell (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2), for reasons that are not well understood. A possible reason could be the release of Interleukin-4 by Mast cells that induce differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells.

The resultant T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells activate an important arm of the immune system, known as the [[humoral immunity|humoral immune system]]. The humoral immune system produces [[antibody|antibodies]] against the inhaled allergen. Later, when a patient inhales the same allergen, these antibodies "recognize" it and activate a [[humoral immunity|humoral response]]. Inflammation results: chemicals are produced that cause the wall of the airway to thicken, cells which produce scarring to proliferate and contribute to further 'airway remodeling', causes mucus producing cells to grow larger and produce more and thicker mucus, and the cell-mediated arm of the immune system is activated. Inflamed airways are more hyper-reactive, and will be more prone to bronchospasm.

The "[[hygiene hypothesis]]" postulates that in early life, an imbalance in the regulation of these T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; cell types leads to a long-term domination of the cells involved in allergic responses over those involved in fighting infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Stiemsma |first1=Leah T |last2=Reynolds |first2=Lisa A |last3=Turvey |first3=Stuart E |last4=Finlay |first4=B Brett |date=2015-07-27 |title=The hygiene hypothesis: current perspectives and future therapies |journal=ImmunoTargets and Therapy |volume=4 |pages=143–157 |doi=10.2147/ITT.S61528 |issn=2253-1556 |pmc=4918254 |pmid=27471720 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=cách chữa hen suyễn triệt để |url=https://thuocnampqa.vn/chua-hen-suyen-khoi-han-bang-dong-y |access-date=20 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion is that for a child being exposed to microbes early in life, taking fewer antibiotics, living in a large family, and growing up in the country stimulate the T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 response and reduce the odds of developing asthma.&lt;ref name="Tippets1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tippets B, Guilbert TW |title=Managing Asthma in Children: Part 1: Making the Diagnosis, Assessing Severity |journal=Consultant for Pediatricians |volume=8 |issue=5 |year=2009 |url=http://www.consultantlive.com/asthma/article/10162/1414747 |access-date=2010-04-14 |archive-date=2009-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204122559/http://www.consultantlive.com/asthma/article/10162/1414747 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asthma is associated with a [[procoagulant]] state in the bronchoalveolar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Boer JD, Majoor CJ, van 't Veer C, Bel EH, van der Poll T |title=Asthma and coagulation |journal=Blood |volume=119 |issue=14 |pages=3236–44 |date=April 2012 |pmid=22262775 |doi=10.1182/blood-2011-11-391532 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathogenesis==
The fundamental problem in asthma appears to be [[immunology|immunological]]: young children in the early stages of asthma show signs of excessive inflammation in their airways. [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological findings]] give clues as to the [[pathogenesis]]: the incidence of asthma seems to be increasing worldwide, and asthma is now very much more common in affluent countries.

In 1968 {{anchor|Andor Szentivanyi|}}Andor Szentivanyi first described ''The Beta Adrenergic Theory of Asthma''; in which blockage of the Beta-2 receptors of pulmonary smooth muscle cells causes asthma.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Szentivanyi, Andor | title=The Beta Adrenergic Theory of the Atopic Abnormality in Asthma | journal=J. Allergy | year=1968 | doi=10.1016/S0021-8707(68)90117-2 | volume=42 | issue=4 | pages=203–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Szentivanyi's Beta Adrenergic Theory is a citation classic&lt;ref name=Tribute&gt;Lockey, Richard, In lasting tribute: Andor Szentivanyi, MD. ''J. Allergy and Clinical Immunology'', January, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Science Citation Index]] and has been cited more times than any other article in the history of the [[Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology]].

In 1995 Szentivanyi and colleagues demonstrated that IgE blocks beta-2 receptors.&lt;!--

==Asthma and sleep apnea==
It is recognized with increasing frequency that patients who have both [[obstructive sleep apnea]] and asthma often improve tremendously when the sleep apnea is diagnosed and treated.&lt;ref name=sleep_anpea1&gt;{{cite press release| title = Breathing disorders during sleep are common among asthma patients, may help predict severe asthma | publisher = University of Michigan Health System | date = May 25, 2005 | url = http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/asthmasleep.htm | access-date = September 23, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118010716/http://www.med.umich.edu/opm/newspage/2005/asthmasleep.htm | archive-date=2006-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Positive airway pressure|CPAP]] is not effective in patients with nocturnal asthma only.&lt;ref name=CPAP_not_an_anti-asthmatic&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sleepapnea.org/resources/pubs/asthma-osa.html | title = Asthma and OSA | access-date = September 23, 2006 | author= Basner RC | date = July 25, 2006 | publisher = American Sleep Apnea Association | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615045132/http://www.sleepapnea.org/resources/pubs/asthma-osa.html|archive-date=2011-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux disease==
If [[gastro-esophageal reflux disease]] (GERD) is present, the patient may have repetitive episodes of acid aspiration. GERD may be common in difficult-to-control asthma, but according to one study, treating it does not seem to affect the asthma.&lt;ref name=Leggett_et_al_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leggett JJ, Johnston BT, Mills M, Gamble J, Heaney LG |title=Prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in difficult asthma: relationship to asthma outcome |journal=Chest |volume=127 |issue=4 |pages=1227–31 |year=2005 |pmid=15821199 |doi=10.1378/chest.127.4.1227 |url=http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/127/4/1227 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000617/http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/content/full/127/4/1227 | archive-date=2007-09-27|citeseerx=10.1.1.561.3736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
When there is a clinical suspicion for GERD as the cause of the asthma, an [[Esophageal pH Monitoring]] is required to confirm the diagnosis and establish the relationship between GERD and asthma.

== Asthma and exposure to air pollution during pregnancy ==
Asthma affects four to eight out of a hundred pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/asthma-during-pregnancy.aspx#|title=Asthma during pregnancy|website=www.marchofdimes.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that during pregnancy, there is an immunological shift due to hormonal fluctuations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Dionne P.|last2=Klein|first2=Sabra L.|author-link2=Sabra Klein |date=2012-08-01|title=Pregnancy and pregnancy-associated hormones alter immune responses and disease pathogenesis|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=62|issue=3|pages=263–271|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2012.02.023|issn=0018-506X|pmc=3376705|pmid=22406114}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, there is an increase in Estrogen levels which in turn reduce the activity of natural killer cells, Th1 cell production of inflammatory cytokines, and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As we have seen, these play an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma.

Researchers found a link between the preterm birth and exposure to air pollution in asthmatic pregnant women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaaai.org/global/latest-research-summaries/Current-JACI-Research/air-pollution-preterm-birth|title=AIR POLLUTION INCREASES PRETERM BIRTH RISK FOR WOMEN WITH ASTHMA|date=March 1, 2016|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results suggested that women with asthma have a higher risk of preterm birth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Researchers suggested that asthmatic episodes in pregnant women were associated with ongoing exposure to nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide - types of air pollutants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Researchers also studied when women were most susceptible to develop asthma. Data indicated that women were at a higher risk of developing asthma when exposed to pollutants before conception and during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In particular, "an increase of 30 parts per billion (ppb) in nitrogen oxide exposure in the three months prior to pregnancy increased preterm birth risk by nearly 30 percent for women with asthma, compared to 8 percent for women without asthma."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In other studies, Scientists have found a link between asthma in children and prenatal exposure to air pollution. Results from a study that consisted of 65, 000 Canadian children suggested that children of mothers who lived near highways during pregnancy had a 25% increased risk of developing asthma before the age of five when compared with children of mothers who did not live near highways.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Sbihi|first1=Hind|last2=Tamburic|first2=Lillian|last3=Koehoorn|first3=Mieke|last4=Brauer|first4=Michael|date=2016-02-09|title=Perinatal air pollution exposure and development of asthma from birth to age 10 years|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2016/02/08/13993003.00746-2015|journal=European Respiratory Journal|language=en|pages=ERJ–00746–2015|doi=10.1183/13993003.00746-2015|issn=0903-1936|pmid=26862123|volume=47|issue=4|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Highways are a major source of traffic-related air pollution such that there is an accumulation of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide (emitted from vehicles) in the vicinity of highways.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In another study, researchers collected data from 6,000 children attending public schools in California. The results suggested that a high exposure to prenatal air pollution was strongly correlated with increased susceptibility to asthma during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.ucla.edu/reportcard/article1700.html|title=Air Pollution Impacts on Infants and Children, UCLA Institute of the Environment and Sustainability|website=www.environment.ucla.edu|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each outpatient procedure is performed approximately three weeks apart.

Under sedation, a catheter inside a [[bronchoscope]]—a thin, flexible tube-like instrument introduced through the patient’s nose or mouth and into their lungs—delivers thermal energy into the airways. The patient is monitored after the procedure and usually returns home the day of the procedure or early the following day. The catheter delivers a series of 10-second temperature controlled bursts of [[radio frequency]] energy which heat the lining of the lungs to 65 degrees Celsius. It is this heat that destroys some of the muscle tissue which constricts during an asthma attack, reducing the number and severity of exacerbations.

Through a standard bronchoscopy procedure, a small flexible tube is advanced into the airway, via mouth or nose, to mildly heat the airway walls. This treatment has been shown to result in acute epithelial destruction with regeneration observed in the [[epithelium]], [[blood vessels]], [[mucosa]] and nerves; however, airway [[smooth muscle]] has demonstrated almost no capacity for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], and it is instead replaced with [[connective tissue]]. The treatment has been shown in prospective studies to be safe and effective with duration up to five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson NC, Rubin AS, Niven RM, Corris PA, Siersted HC, Olivenstein R, Pavord ID, McCormack D, Laviolette M, Shargill NS, Cox G | display-authors = 6 | title = Long-term (5 year) safety of bronchial thermoplasty: Asthma Intervention Research (AIR) trial | journal = BMC Pulmonary Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 8 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21314924 | pmc = 3045390 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2466-11-8 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronchial thermoplasty is indicated for the treatment of severe persistent asthma in patients 18 years and older whose asthma is not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta agonists as per GINA guidelines.

Additionally, when compared to control patients, patients treated with bronchial thermoplasty also experienced the following benefits, although none reached statistical significance:
*32% reduction in asthma attacks
*84% reduction in emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms
*66% reduction in days lost from work, school, or other daily activities due to asthma symptoms
*73% reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms

==Risks==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}

In the period immediately following the bronchial thermoplasty procedure, there was an expected transient increase in the frequency and worsening of respiratory-related symptoms. Bronchial thermoplasty is not appropriate for patients who:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson NC | title = Recent Developments In Bronchial Thermoplasty For Severe Asthma | language = English | journal = Journal of Asthma and Allergy | volume = 12 | pages = 375–387 | date = 2019-11-19 | pmid = 31819539 | pmc = 6875488 | doi = 10.2147/JAA.S200912 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reactive airway disease''' ('''RAD''') is an informal label that physicians apply to patients with symptoms similar to those of [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Fahy|first1=John V.|last2=O'Byrne|first2=Paul M.|date=2001-03-15|title='Reactive Airways Disease'. A lazy term of uncertain meaning that should be abandoned.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|language=en|volume=163|issue=4|pages=822–823|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.163.4.2005049|pmid=11282751|issn=1073-449X}}&lt;/ref&gt; An exact definition of the condition does not exist.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaaai.org/ask-the-expert/reactive-airways-disease|title=Definition of Reactive Airways Disease|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who are typically labeled as having RAD generally have a history of wheezing, coughing, [[Shortness of breath|dyspnea]], and production of sputum that may or may not be caused by asthma. Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2023}} Physicians most commonly label patients with RAD when they are hesitant about formally diagnosing a patient with asthma, which is most prevalent in the pediatric setting. While some physicians may use ''RAD'' and ''asthma'' synonymously, there is controversy over this usage.

More generally, there is controversy over the use of RAD as a label in the healthcare setting, largely due to the ambiguous definition that the term has.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since RAD is not recognized as a real clinical diagnosis, its meaning is highly inconsistent and may cause confusion and misdiagnosis within the medical community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are also concerns with overtreatment and undertreatment with RAD amongst physicians, since there is little formality with the label.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Other problems that healthcare workers have with the use of the RAD label include its exclusion in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]], which can lead to billing issues in hospitals and other health care facilities, and the creation of a fabricated sense of security when using it has a diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

RAD can be confused with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, an asthma-like disorder that results from high exposure to vapors, fumes, and/or smoke. Unlike RAD, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is recognized by multiple societies as a real clinical syndrome, including the [[American Thoracic Society]] and the [[American College of Chest Physicians]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Terminology==
[[File:Asthma (Lungs).png|thumb|It is common to see RAD incorrectly used as a synonym for asthma.]]
The term ''reactive airway disease'' originally began to appear in medical literature in the 1980s in reference to asthmatic patients with hyperactive airways, which is a common feature of asthma. This feature is characterized by increased [[bronchoconstriction]] reactions in response to stimuli that should not elicit so strong of response. These stimuli can include [[methacholine]], [[histamine]], and distilled water. However, while this was how the term initially was introduced, ''RAD'' soon began to be used interchangeably with the term ''asthma'' itself, which has led to the current controversy over its place in medical diagnoses.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Douglas|first1=Lindsey C.|last2=Feder|first2=Katherine J.|date=2017-01-01|title=RAD: Reactive Airways Disease or Really Asthma Disease?|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/1/e20160625|journal=Pediatrics|language=en|volume=139|issue=1|pages=e20160625|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-0625|issn=0031-4005|pmid=28031454|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More commonly, RAD is now mostly used by physicians when they are hesitant to diagnose a patient with asthma. This is most prominent in pediatric settings for a variety of reasons. While infants tend to wheeze more often than adults, only one-third of them eventually go on to actually have asthma. Asthma and viral bronchiolitis can also be nearly identical to each other when presented in very young children, since they both consist of wheezing, coughing, and nasal congestion. In addition, typical tests used to accurately diagnose children with asthma, such as the [[bronchial challenge test]], are not considered to be accurate for children under the age of five. This can be due to failure of very young children to cooperate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/expert-answers/reactive-airway-disease/faq-20058010|title=Reactive airway disease: Is it asthma?|work=Mayo Clinic|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diagnosing a child with asthma also carries a certain negative connotation, causing hesitancy from some physicians to do so. All of these factors lead physicians to label young children with RAD instead of asthma, since the disease is often only suspected and unable to be confirmed with pediatric patients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Physicians will generally label an adult with RAD if they have no prior diagnosis or history of asthma while exhibiting symptoms of wheezing, production of sputum, and/or the use of an inhaler.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2023}} In order to make a formal asthma diagnosis in adult patients, there is requirement to have documentation of either airway hyperreactivity or some sort of reversible airway obstruction. If none of these symptoms are present in an adult patients' medical history or documentation, the physician may label the patient with RAD instead of asthma in order to still indicate there is an airway issue without formal diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome==
While the acronyms are similar, reactive airway disease (RAD) and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) are not the same.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome was first identified by [[Stuart M. Brooks]] and colleagues in 1985 as an asthma-like syndrome developing after a single exposure to high levels of an irritating vapor, fume, or smoke.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS): persistent asthma syndrome after high level irritant exposures|journal = Chest|volume = 88|issue = 3|pages = 376–84|author1=S.M. Brooks|author2=M.A. Weiss|publisher=Chest, Volume 88, 1985, 376-384|author3=I.L. Bernstein|pmid = 4028848|year = 1985|doi = 10.1378/chest.88.3.376}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can manifest in adults with exposure to high levels of [[chlorine]], [[ammonia]], [[acetic acid]], or [[sulphur dioxide]], creating symptoms like asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Shakeri|first1=M. S.|last2=Dick|first2=F. D.|last3=Ayres|first3=J. G.|date=2008-05-01|title=Which agents cause reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS)? A systematic review|journal=Occupational Medicine|language=en|volume=58|issue=3|pages=205–211|doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn013|pmid=18308694|issn=0962-7480|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; These symptoms can vary from mild to fatal and can even create long-term airway damage, depending on the amount of exposure and the concentration of chlorine. Patients that have been diagnosed with RADS will likely have methacholine airway hyperreactivity, yet other tests that also measure pulmonary functions may appear normal.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some experts classify RADS as occupational asthma. Those with exposure to highly irritating substances should receive treatment to mitigate harmful effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aslan|first1=Sahin|last2=Kandiş|first2=Hayati|last3=Akgun|first3=Metin|last4=Çakır|first4=Zeynep|last5=Inandı|first5=Tacettin|last6=Görgüner|first6=Metin|year=2006|title=The effect of nebulized NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; treatment on 'RADS' due to chlorine gas inhalation|volume=18|pages=895–900|doi=10.1080/08958370600822615|pmid=16864407|journal=Inhalation Toxicology|number=11|s2cid=26471244 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for RADS is similar to treatment for other disorders that result from acute inhalation. Preexisting allergies can be a risk factor for developing RADS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks |first1=SM|last2=Hammad |first2=Y|last3=Richards |first3=I|last4=Giovinco-Barbas |first4=J |last5=Jenkins |first5=K|date=Jan 1998|title=The spectrum of irritant induced asthma: sudden and not-so-sudden onset and the role of allergy.|journal =  Chest|volume=113|issue=1|pages=42–9|pmid=9440566|doi=10.1378/chest.113.1.42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between RAD and RADS is that RADS can occur after just one exposure to the inhalants and without any prior sensitization. In addition, although the symptoms of RADS are very similar to those of asthma, they may be resolved. While some physicians argue that RADS is also not a real clinical syndrome, it is more commonly recognized in legitimate associations than RAD. These associations include the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Controversy over use ==
[[File:ICD-10-CM (2010).djvu|thumb|First page of the 2010 ICD]]
There remains controversy over the use of RAD as an unofficial diagnosis. With its use not only being limited to clinical lexicon, but also transitioning to clinical literature now, more physicians are now increasingly disapproving its use in the healthcare setting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One of the largest problems with the using RAD as a diagnostic label lies in the ambiguity of its meaning, as RAD has no true clinical definition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is either not listed or redirects to "asthma" in all major medical journal or website. In addition to that, it is also not recognized in the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]; the American Thoracic Society; or the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|National Heart Lung and Blood Institute]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition, treatments for asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or pneumonia may not be prescribed under a label of reactive airway disease.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In contrast, some physicians also fear overtreatment for RAD, as patients can be prescribed inhaled [[Beta agonists|beta-agonists]] or inhaled [[corticosteroid]]s, which are medications used for asthma. If an individual with RAD does not have asthma, there is no evidence these treatments are beneficial.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result of its ambiguous place in the medical field, the symptoms used to characterize it are often inconsistent and can lead to confusion in a healthcare setting. This is a troubling issue for many physicians, as care can be made more complicated; many patients labeled with RAD do not ultimately have asthma and most RAD patients have never formally had their airway reactivity measured.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to the inconsistencies of its labeling, there is also no billing designation for RAD in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or the ICD, which can lead to problems for healthcare facilities. Searches in the ICD, point to content relating to asthma.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some medical professionals argue that using RAD as a diagnosis will only complicate research on asthma in the context of clinical research and epidemiology. There is also dispute that by giving physicians the ability to label a patient with RAD, it gives them a fabricated sense of security that they have made a diagnosis, when no real recognizable diagnosis has been concluded.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Metered-dose Inhaler.JPG|thumb|Metered-dose Inhaler]]
A '''metered-dose inhaler''' ('''MDI''') is a device that delivers a specific amount of medication to the [[lung]]s, in the form of a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually self-administered by the patient via inhalation. It is the most commonly used delivery system for treating [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) and other respiratory diseases. The medication in a metered dose inhaler is most commonly a [[bronchodilator]], [[corticosteroid]] or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Other medications less commonly used but also administered by MDI are mast cell stabilizers, such as [[cromoglicate]] or [[nedocromil]].

== Description ==
[[File:MDI components.jpg|thumb|MDI canister and actuator components from H&amp;T Presspart]]

A metered-dose inhaler consists of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of [[deep drawing]], where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs.&lt;ref&gt;''Pharmaceutical Inhalation Aerosol Technology'', ed. A. J. Hickey, 2nd edition, Marcel Dekker Inc., NY, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="EoPT" /&gt; The formulation itself is made up of the drug, a liquefied gas propellant and, in many cases, stabilising [[excipients]]. The actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination.

To use the inhaler the patient presses down on the top of the canister, with their thumb supporting the lower portion of the actuator. Actuation of the device releases a single metered dose of the formulation which contains the medication either dissolved or suspended in the propellant. Breakup of the volatile propellant into droplets, followed by rapid evaporation of these droplets, results in the generation of an aerosol consisting of micrometer-sized medication particles that are then inhaled.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, W. H., ''The Mechanics of Inhaled Pharmaceutical Aerosols: An Introduction'', Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Nicorette Inhalator.jpg|thumb|[[Nicorette]] Inhalator is a vapour inhalator.]]

Metered-dose inhalers are only one type of [[inhaler]], but they are the most commonly used type. The replacement of [[chlorofluorocarbons]] propellants with [[hydrofluoroalkanes]] (HFA) resulted in the redesign of metered-dose inhalers in the 1990s. For one variety of [[beclomethasone]] inhaler, this redesign resulted in considerably smaller aerosol particles being produced, and led to an increase of potency by a factor of 2.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Busse W, Colice G, Hannon S | year = 1998 | title = CFC-BDP require 2.6 times the dose to achieve equivalent improvement in FEV1 as HFA-BDP | journal = Am J Respir Crit Med | volume = 157 | page = A405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These devices are made of thin plastic, sometimes resembling a cigarette, or a cylinder shape. They contain a porous nicotine-filled plug, located in the base of the product. When you puff on the inhaler, nicotine aerosol is inhaled and absorbed in the mouth’s lining. Every inhaler delivers almost four hundred puffs of this nicotine vapor. The nicotine inhaler is also temperature sensitive. In cooler weather, less nicotine is delivered. The nicotine inhaler is considered easier to use than the electronic cigarette as it is usually disposable, and contains fewer parts than the electronic cigarette.
** Nicotine inhalers also exist as non-MDIs, for example, the format for the Nicorette Inhalator is an “inhalation vapour solution”.
*''[[Dry powder inhaler]]s''  involve micronised powder often packaged in single dose quantities in [[Blister pack|blisters]] or gel capsules containing the powdered medication to be drawn into the [[lung]]s by the user's own breath. These systems tend to be more expensive than the MDI, and patients with severely compromised lung function, such as occurs during an asthma attack, may find it difficult to generate enough airflow to get good function from them.
*Metered-dose inhalers can be used to treat COPD, both in stable state and during lung attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Bronchodilators delivered by nebuliser versus pMDI with spacer or DPI for exacerbations of COPD|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 8|pages = CD011826|last1=van Geffen|first1=Wouter H|last2=Douma|first2=W R|last3=Slebos|first3=Dirk Jan|last4=Kerstjens|first4=Huib AM|date=2016-08-29| volume=2016 |doi=10.1002/14651858.cd011826.pub2|pmid = 27569680| pmc=8487315 |url = https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/36833530/Geffen_et_al_2016_The_Cochrane_Library.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Before the invention of the MDI, asthma medication was delivered using a squeeze bulb [[nebulizer]] which was fragile and unreliable.&lt;ref name="Purewal 1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Purewal|first=Tol S.|author2=D. Grant|title=Metered Dose Inhaler Technology|publisher=Informa Health Care|year=1997|edition=Illustrated|isbn=978-1-57491-065-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively crude nature of these devices also meant that the particles that they generated were relatively large, too large for effective drug delivery to the lungs.&lt;ref name="EoPT"&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3rd Illustrated| publisher = Informa Health Care| isbn = 978-0-8493-9394-5| pages = 1170| last = Swarbrick| first = James| title = Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology| year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless these nebulizers paved the way for inhalation drug delivery providing the inspiration for the MDI.

MDIs were first developed in 1955 by Riker Laboratories, now a subsidiary of [[3M|3M Healthcare]].&lt;ref name="Purewal 1997" /&gt;  At that time MDIs represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies, the [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] propellant and the Meshburg metering valve which was originally designed for dispensing perfume.&lt;ref name="Clark 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/02786829408959755| volume = 22| issue = 4| pages = 374–391| last = Clark| first = A. R| title = Medical Aerosol Inhalers: Past, Present, and Future| journal = Aerosol Science and Technology| year = 1995| bibcode = 1995AerST..22..374C| doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial design by Riker used a glass canister coated with a vinyl plastic to improve its resilience.&lt;ref name="Purewal 1997" /&gt;  By 1956 Riker had developed two MDI based products, the Medihaler-Ept containing [[epinephrine]] and the Medihaler-Iso containing [[Isoprenaline]].&lt;ref name="EoPT" /&gt;  Both products are [[agonist]]s which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by [[salbutamol]], which is more selective.

== Spacers ==
{{main|Asthma spacer}}
Metered-dose inhalers are sometimes used with add-on devices referred to as holding chambers or spacers, which are tubes attached to the inhaler that act as a reservoir or holding chamber and reduce the speed at which the aerosol enters the mouth. They serve to hold the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler. This makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps ensure that more of the medication gets into the lungs instead of just into the mouth or the air. With proper use, a spacer can make an inhaler somewhat more effective in delivering medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Togger D., Brenner P. | year = 2001 | title = Metered dose inhalers | journal = American Journal of Nursing | volume = 101 | issue = 10| page = 29 | doi = 10.1097/00000446-200110000-00020 | pmid = 11680341 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spacers can be especially helpful to adults and children who find a regular metered dose inhaler hard to use. People who use corticosteroid inhalers should use a spacer to prevent getting the medicine in their mouth, where [[Oral candidiasis|oral yeast infections]] and [[dysphonia]] can occur.&lt;ref&gt;""Inhalation Aerosols: Physical and Biological Basis for Therapy"", ed. A. J. Hickey, 2nd edition, Informa Healthcare, NY, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifespan and replacement ==


The deposition of the content of drug formulation on the canister surface can result in a shorter shelf life of an MDI [[inhaler]]. Applying a suitable surface coating to the components helps to extend this shelf life. Over the years a range of coating processes have been developed that can be applied to both the canister and valve to protect the contents from deposition and degradation.
Gas plasma processing is an industrial technique that is carried out in a vacuum to coat the entire MDI [[inhaler]] and involves constant or pulsed excitation of gas by either Radio Frequency (RF) or microwave field to produce an energetic plasma. This coating ensures that the drug formulation does not stick to the interior wall of the MD [[inhaler]] and results in the patient receiving the prescribed dose of medication, whilst also extending the product's shelf-life.

A metered dose inhaler contains enough medication for a certain number of actuations (or "puffs") which is printed on the canister.  Even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses, the amount of medication delivered may not be correct. It is important to keep track of the number of times an inhaler was used, so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses. For this reason, several regulatory authorities have requested that manufacturers add a dose counter or dose indicator to the actuator. Several inhalation products are now sold with a dose counter-actuator. Depending on the manufacturer and the product, inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription.

== Inhaler technique and use ==
While MDIs are commonly used in the treatment of lung-based disorders, their use requires dexterity to complete the required sequential steps to achieve application of these devices.  Incorrect completion of one or more steps in the use of an MDI can substantially reduce the delivery of the administered medication and consequently its effectiveness and safety. Numerous studies have demonstrated that between 50-100% of patients do not use their inhaler devices correctly, with patients often unaware that they are using their inhaled medication incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vanderman|first1=Adam J.|last2=Moss|first2=Jason M.|last3=Bailey|first3=Janine C.|last4=Melnyk|first4=S.

== Propellants ==
[[File:Cipla inhaler.jpg|thumb|CFC-free Asthalin HFA inhaler]]
One of the most crucial components of a MDI is its propellant. The propellant provides the force to generate the aerosol cloud and is also the medium in which the active component must be suspended or dissolved. Propellants in MDIs typically make up more than 99% of the delivered dose,&lt;ref name=Noakes&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Noakes| first = T | title = Medical Aerosol Propellants  | journal = Journal of Fluorine Chemistry  | volume = 118  | issue = 1–2  | pages = 35–45  | year = 2002  | doi =   10.1016/S0022-1139(02)00191-4  }}&lt;/ref&gt; so it is the properties of the propellant that dominate more than any other individual factor.  This is often overlooked in literature and in industry because so few propellants are used and their contribution is often taken for granted.  Suitable propellants must pass a stringent set of criteria, they must:
* have a boiling point in the range -100 to +30&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipacmdi.com/documents/EPC.pdf|title=Ensuring Patient Care|author1=William Gore|author2=Ian Tansey|publisher=[[International Pharmaceutical Aerosol Consortium|IPAC]]|access-date=2009-04-14|display-authors=etal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041328/http://www.ipacmdi.com/documents/EPC.pdf|archive-date=2008-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have a density of approximately 1.2 to 1.5 g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; (approximately that of the drug to be suspended or dissolved)&lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;
* have a [[vapour pressure]] of 40 to 80 psig &lt;ref name=Leach&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Leach| first = C L | title = Approaches and Challenges to Use Freon Propellant Replacements  | journal = Aerosol Science and Technology  | volume = 22  | issue = 4  | pages = 328–334  | year = 1995  | doi =   10.1080/02786829408959750| bibcode = 1995AerST..22..328L | doi-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* have no toxicity to the patient &lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;
* be non-flammable &lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leach/&gt;
* be able to dissolve common additives (active ingredients should be either fully soluble or fully insoluble)&lt;ref name=Noakes/&gt;

=== Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) ===
In the early days of MDIs the most commonly used propellants were the [[chlorofluorocarbons]] [[CFC-11]], [[CFC-12]] and [[CFC-114]].

In 2008 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] announced that inhalers using [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s as a propellant, such as [[Primatene Mist]], could no longer be manufactured or sold as of 2012.&lt;ref name="cnn2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/22/no-more-primatene-mist-in-the-u-s-after-this-year/|title=No more Primatene Mist in the U.S. after this year|author=Saundra Young|date=September 22, 2011|work=The Chart (blog)|access-date=2011-09-22|publisher=CNN|archive-date=2011-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922181217/http://thechart.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/22/no-more-primatene-mist-in-the-u-s-after-this-year/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed from the U.S. decision to agree to the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]] on Substances that deplete the ozone layer.&lt;ref name="CFCdiscontinued"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/gef/05/documents/publications/MontrealProtocol_WEB.pdf|title=The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227134139/http://www.undp.org/gef/05/documents/publications/MontrealProtocol_WEB.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-27|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrofluorocarbons ===
CFC propellants have been replaced by [[hydrofluorocarbon]] propellants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fluorocarbons.org/metered-dose-inhalers-mdis/|title=Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs)|website=Fluorocarbons|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the use of [[hydrofluorocarbon]] propellants have however since arisen since these compounds are potent [[greenhouse gas]]es; propellant released during the use of a single inhaler results in a greenhouse footprint equivalent to greenhouse gases released during a 180-mile car journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/08/asthma-inhalers-bad-environment-180-mile-car-journey-health/|title=Asthma inhalers as bad for the environment as 180-mile car journey, health chiefs say|last=Bodkin|first=Henry|date=2019-04-08|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-04-09|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surfactant lipids ==
[[Phospholipids]] are important natural [[surfactant]] lipids &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/EP1658851A1.pdf Anti-asthmatic combinations comprising surface active phospholipids]&lt;/ref&gt; used in enhancing penetration and bioavailability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20120308617.pdf PHOSPHOLIPID-BASED INHALATION SYSTEM]&lt;/ref&gt; Phospholipids act by reducing the high [[surface tension]] forces at the air-water interface within the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], thereby reducing the pressure needed to expand the lungs, Thus, commercially available formulations of phospholipids have been designed to spread rapidly over an air-aqueous interface, thereby reducing what is otherwise a very high surface tension of water.

== Colours ==
For ease of identification, many MDI's are colour-coded

While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition.&lt;ref name=M38/&gt; It is defined by the [[Global Initiative for Asthma]] as "a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment".&lt;ref name=GINA2011p2 /&gt;

There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.&lt;ref name=Lemanske2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=M38/&gt; Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution.&lt;ref name=NAEPP42&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spirometry]] is then used to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=NAEPP42/&gt; In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.&lt;ref name=GINA2011p20&gt;{{harvnb|GINA|2011|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second ([[spirometry|FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]), and [[peak expiratory flow rate]].&lt;ref name=Yawn2008/&gt; Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic).&lt;ref name="RobbinsCotran2010"/&gt; While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system.&lt;ref name=Moore2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moore WC, Pascual RM | title = Update in asthma 2009 | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 181 | issue = 11 | pages = 1181–7 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20516492 | pmc = 3269238 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.201003-0321UP }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.&lt;ref name=Moore2010/&gt; Recently, asthma has been classified based on whether it is associated with type 2 or non–type 2 inflammation.

Although asthma is a chronic [[obstructive lung disease|obstructive]] condition, it is not considered as a part of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as [[bronchiectasis]] and [[Pneumatosis#Lungs|emphysema]].&lt;ref name="Self, Timothy 2009"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = Koda-Kimble MA, Alldredge BK | vauthors = Self T, Chrisman C, Finch C |title=Applied therapeutics: the clinical use of drugs |edition=9th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2009 |chapter=22.

An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an ''asthma attack''.

Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory [[muscle]]s of respiration ([[sternocleidomastoid]] and [[scalene muscles]] of the neck), there may be a [[pulsus paradoxus|paradoxical pulse]] (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest.&lt;ref name=Maitre1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maitre B, Similowski T, Derenne JP | title = Physical examination of the adult patient with respiratory diseases: inspection and palpation | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 1584–93 | date = September 1995 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.95.08091584 | pmid = 8575588 | s2cid = 30677275 | url = http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/8/9/1584.long | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150429223309/http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/8/9/1584.long | archive-date = 2015-04-29 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cyanosis|blue color]] of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.&lt;ref name=Werner2001&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Werner HA | title = Status asthmaticus in children: a review | journal = Chest | volume = 119 | issue = 6 | pages = 1913–29 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11399724 | doi = 10.1378/chest.119.6.1913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===

Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NAEPP46/&gt; --&gt; In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as [[allergic rhinitis]] and [[sinusitis]], as well as other causes of airway obstruction including [[foreign body aspiration]], [[tracheal stenosis]], [[laryngotracheomalacia]], [[vascular ring]]s, enlarged [[lymph nodes]] or neck masses.&lt;ref name=NAEPP46/&gt; [[Bronchiolitis]] and other viral infections may also produce wheezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Lichtenstein R |title=Pediatric emergencies|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-323-22733-9|pages = 1022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H_oxAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1022|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908184941/https://books.google.com/books?id=H_oxAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1022|archive-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[European Respiratory Society]], it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term "asthma" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Bever HP, Han E, Shek L, Yi Chng S, Goh D | title = An approach to preschool wheezing: to label as asthma? | journal = The World Allergy Organization Journal | volume = 3 | issue = 11 | pages = 253–257 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 23282943 | pmc = 3651058 | doi = 10.1097/WOX.0b013e3181fc7fa1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults, [[COPD]], [[congestive heart failure]], airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to [[ACE inhibitor]]s may cause similar symptoms.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=NAEPP46&gt; --&gt; In both populations [[vocal cord dysfunction]] may present similarly.&lt;ref name=NAEPP46&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson PG, McDonald VM, Marks GB | s2cid = 12275555 | title = Asthma in older adults | journal = Lancet | volume = 376 | issue = 9743 | pages = 803–13 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20816547 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61087-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.&lt;ref name="pmid16880365"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hargreave FE, Parameswaran K | title = Asthma, COPD and bronchitis are just components of airway disease | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 264–7 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16880365 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.06.00056106 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Applied Therapeutics 2009"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Diaz PK |title=Applied therapeutics: the clinical use of drugs |edition=9th |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |year=2009 |chapter=23.

Medications are typically provided as [[metered-dose inhaler]]s (MDIs) in combination with an [[asthma spacer]] or as a [[dry powder inhaler]]. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A [[nebulizer]] may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease.&lt;ref name="NHLBI07p250"&gt;{{harvnb|NHLBI Guideline|2007|p=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cates CJ, Welsh EJ, Rowe BH | title = Holding chambers (spacers) versus nebulisers for beta-agonist treatment of acute asthma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD000052 | date = September 2013 | volume = 2013 | pmid = 24037768 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000052.pub3 | pmc = 7032675 |collaboration = Cochrane Airways Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Travers AH, Milan SJ, Jones AP, Camargo CA, Rowe BH | title = Addition of intravenous beta(2)-agonists to inhaled beta(2)-agonists for acute asthma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD010179 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 23235685 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rodriguez C, Sossa M, Lozano JM | title = Commercial versus home-made spacers in delivering bronchodilator therapy for acute therapy in children | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 2 | pages = CD005536 | date = April 2008 | volume = 2017 | pmid = 18425921 | pmc = 6483735 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005536.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Population-based epidemiological studies describe temporal associations between acute respiratory illnesses, asthma, and development of severe asthma with irreversible airflow limitation (known as the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease "overlap" syndrome, or ACOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rantala A, Jaakkola JJ, Jaakkola MS | title = Respiratory infections precede adult-onset asthma | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = e27912 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22205932 | pmc = 3244385 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0027912 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...627912R | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeh JJ, Wang YC, Hsu WH, Kao CH | title = Incident asthma and Mycoplasma pneumoniae: A nationwide cohort study | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 137 | issue = 4 | pages = 1017–1023.e6 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26586037 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2015.09.032 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva GE, Sherrill DL, Guerra S, Barbee RA | title = Asthma as a risk factor for COPD in a longitudinal study | journal = Chest | volume = 126 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–65 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15249443 | doi = 10.1378/chest.126.1.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional prospective population-based data indicate that ACOS seems to represent a form of severe asthma, characterised by more frequent hospitalisations, and to be the result of early-onset asthma that has progressed to fixed airflow obstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Marco R, Marcon A, Rossi A, Antó JM, Cerveri I, Gislason T, Heinrich J, Janson C, Jarvis D, Kuenzli N, Leynaert B, Probst-Hensch N, Svanes C, Wjst M, Burney P | display-authors = 6 | title = Asthma, COPD and overlap syndrome: a longitudinal study in young European adults | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 3 | pages = 671–679 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26113674 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.00008615 | s2cid = 2169875 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asthma was recognized in [[ancient Egypt]] and was treated by drinking an [[incense]] mixture known as [[kyphi]].&lt;ref name="Manniche1999" /&gt; It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by [[Hippocrates]] circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for "panting" forming the basis of our modern name.&lt;ref name="M38" /&gt; In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions.&lt;ref name="Andrew2010" /&gt; In the 12th century the Jewish physician-philosopher [[Maimonides]] wrote a treatise on asthma in Arabic, based partly on Arabic sources, in which he discussed the symptoms, proposed various dietary and other means of treatment, and emphasized the importance of climate and clean air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.aecom.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/EJBM/19Rosner125.pdf | vauthors = Rosner F |author-link=Fred Rosner |title=The Life of Moses Maimonides, a Prominent Medieval Physician |journal=Einstein Quart J Biol Med |year=2002 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=125–28 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305065423/http://www.aecom.yu.edu/uploadedFiles/EJBM/19Rosner125.pdf |archive-date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Traditional Medicine also offered medication for asthma, as indicated by a surviving 14th century manuscript curated by the Wellcome Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;C14 Chinese medication chart; Asthma etc. Wellcome L0039608&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the [[pathophysiology]] of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with [[A.B.C. Liniment|chloroform liniment]].&lt;ref name="pmid20747287"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thorowgood JC | title = On Bronchial Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = 673 | pages = 600 | date = November 1873 | pmid = 20747287 | pmc = 2294647 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.2.673.600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20746575"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gaskoin G | title = On the Treatment of Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 587 | pages = 339 | date = March 1872 | pmid = 20746575 | pmc = 2297349 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.587.339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pharmaceutical drug|Medical treatment]] in 1880 included the use of [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] doses of a drug called [[pilocarpine]].&lt;ref name="pmid20749537"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkart JB | title = The Treatment of Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1016 | pages = 917–8 | date = June 1880 | pmid = 20749537 | pmc = 2240555 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.1016.917 }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkart JB | title = The Treatment of Asthma | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 1 | issue = 1017 | pages = 960–2 | date = June 1880 | pmid = 20749546 | pmc = 2240530 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.1017.960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, F.

A well-documented case in the 19th century was that of young [[Theodore Roosevelt#Early life and family|Theodore Roosevelt]] (1858–1919). At that time there was no effective treatment. Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health partly related to his asthma. He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that felt as if he was being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = McCullough D |title=Mornings on Horseback: The Story of an Extraordinary Family, a Vanished Way of Life and the Unique Child Who Became Theodore Roosevelt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&amp;pg=PA93|year=1981|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=93–108|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407004947/http://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&amp;pg=PA93|archive-date=2015-04-07|isbn=978-0-7432-1830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s to 1950s, asthma was known as one of the "holy seven" [[psychosomatic illness]]es. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other [[talking cure]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid16185365"/&gt; As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.&lt;ref name="pmid16185365"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Opolski M, Wilson I | title = Asthma and depression: a pragmatic review of the literature and recommendations for future research | journal = Clinical Practice and Epidemiology in Mental Health | volume = 1 | pages = 18 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16185365 | pmc = 1253523 | doi = 10.1186/1745-0179-1-18 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2021, an appeal court in [[France]] overturned a deportation order against a 40-year-old Bangladeshi man, who was a patient of asthma. His lawyers had argued that the dangerous levels of [[pollution]] in [[Bangladesh]] could possibly lead to worsening of his health condition, or even premature death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/12/bangladeshi-man-with-asthma-wins-france-deportation-fight|title=Bangladeshi man with asthma wins France deportation fight|access-date=12 January 2021|website=The Guardian|date=12 January 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dynamic hyperinflation''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume.&lt;ref name="pmid15636649"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanch L, Bernabé F, Lucangelo U | title=Measurement of air trapping, intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, and dynamic hyperinflation in mechanically ventilated patients. | journal=[[Respir Care]] | year= 2005 | volume= 50 | issue= 1 | pages= 110–23; discussion 123–4 | pmid=15636649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In simpler terms, this means that a new breath starts before the usual amount of air has been breathed out, leading to a build-up of air in the lungs, and causing breathing in and out to take place when the lung is nearly full.

{{Main article|Asthma}}
Dynamic hyperinflation can occur in patients with [[asthma]] who are breathing spontaneously. It is a physiologic response to airflow obstruction and exists, to an extent, because increasing lung volume tends to increase airway caliber and can reduce the resistive work of breathing. However, in patients with severe asthma it becomes maladaptive, occurring at the expense of increased mechanical load and elastic work of breathing.&lt;ref name="pmid11399724"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Werner HA| title=Status asthmaticus in children: a review. | journal=Chest | year= 2001 | volume= 119 | issue= 6 | pages= 1913–29 | pmid=11399724 | doi= 10.1378/chest.119.6.1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dynamic hyperinflation can cause alveolar overdistention resulting in hypoxemia, hypotension, or alveolar rupture. Dynamic hyperinflation increases the magnitude of the drop in airway pressure that the patient must generate to trigger a breath, thereby increasing the patient's workload.

===Status asthmaticus===
{{Main article|Acute severe asthma}}
Patients with [[acute severe asthma]] exacerbations are at risk for progressive air trapping and alveolar hyperinflation, which may lead to alveolar rupture and hemodynamic compromise. Airflow obstruction during expiration slows lung emptying and inspiration may be initiated before exhalation is complete. The phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume is called dynamic hyperinflation.&lt;ref name="pmid15636649"/&gt;

==Interventions==
Interventions to correct air-trapping include decreasing the respiratory rate (increasing expiratory time), increasing inspiratory flow rates (decreasing the inspiratory time) and lowering the [[tidal volume]].&lt;ref name="pmid11940264"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Papiris S, Kotanidou A, Malagari K, Roussos C | title=Clinical review: severe asthma. | journal=Crit Care | year= 2002 | volume= 6 | issue= 1 | pages= 30–44 | pmid=11940264 | doi= 10.1186/cc1451| pmc=137395 | doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adults===
In adults, it has been demonstrated that limiting minute ventilation is the key to avoiding dynamic hyperinflation; keeping the minute ventilation under 115/mL/kg is recommended&lt;ref name="pmid11940264"/&gt;

'''Bronchospasm''' or a '''bronchial spasm''' is a sudden [[bronchoconstriction|constriction]] of the muscles in the walls of the [[bronchiole]]s. It is caused by the release ([[degranulation]]) of substances from [[mast cells]] or [[basophil]]s under the influence of [[anaphylatoxin]]s. It causes difficulty in breathing which ranges from mild to severe.

Bronchospasms occur in [[asthma]], chronic [[bronchitis]] and [[anaphylaxis]].  Bronchospasms are a possible side effect of some drugs: [[pilocarpine]], [[beta blocker]]s (used to treat hypertension), a paradoxical result of using [[Long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist|LABA]] drugs (to treat [[COPD]]), and other drugs.  Bronchospasms can present as a sign of [[giardiasis]].

Some factors that contribute to bronchospasm include consuming certain foods, taking certain medicines, allergic responses to insects, and fluctuating hormone levels, particularly in women.&lt;ref name=Haggerty2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)61794-2 |pmid=12669890 |title=The impact of estrogen and progesterone on asthma |year=2003 |last1=Haggerty |first1=Catherine L. |last2=Ness |first2=Roberta B. |last3=Kelsey |first3=Sheryl |last4=Waterer |first4=Grant W. |journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=284–91; quiz 291–3, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hatfield&gt;{{cite web |author=Hatfield |title=Asthma in Women |url=http://www.webmd.com/asthma/features/asthma-women}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bronchospasms are one of several conditions associated with cold housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02673030050009258 |title=Housing Deprivation and Health: A Longitudinal Analysis |year=2000 |last1=Marsh |first1=Alex |last2=Gordon |first2=David |last3=Heslop |first3=Pauline |last4=Pantazis |first4=Christina |journal=Housing Studies |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=411|s2cid=154051241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overactivity of the bronchioles' muscle is a result of exposure to a stimulus which under normal circumstances would cause little or no response. The resulting constriction and inflammation causes a narrowing of the airways and an increase in [[mucus]] production; this reduces the amount of [[oxygen]] that is available to the individual causing breathlessness, coughing and [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].

Bronchospasms are a serious potential complication of placing a [[Tracheal tube|breathing tube]] during [[general anesthesia]]. When the airways spasm or constrict in response to the irritating stimulus of the breathing tube, it is difficult to maintain the airway and the patient can become [[apneic]]. During general anesthesia, signs of bronchospasm include wheezing, high peak inspiratory pressures, increased intrinsic [[PEEP]], decreased expiratory tidal volumes, and an upsloping capnograph (obstructive pattern).&amp;nbsp; In severe cases, there may be complete inability to ventilate and loss of [[ETCO2]] as well as hypoxia and desaturation.

==Cause==
Bronchospasms can occur for a number of reasons. Lower respiratory tract conditions such as [[asthma]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), and [[emphysema]] can result in contraction of the airways. Other causes are side effects of topical decongestants such as [[oxymetazoline]] and [[phenylephrine]]. Both of these medications activate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that result in smooth muscle constriction. Non-selective [[beta blockers]] are known to facilitate bronchospasm as well. Beta blockers bind to the β2 receptors and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine causing shortness of breath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahmed |first1=Rubab |last2=Branley |first2=Howard M. |title=Reversible bronchospasm with the cardio-selective beta-blocker celiprolol in a non-asthmatic subject |journal=Respiratory Medicine CME |date=1 January 2009 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=141–143 |doi=10.1016/j.rmedc.2008.10.019 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755001708001036 |issn=1755-0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the pediatric population is more susceptible to disease and complications from bronchospasm due to their airway diameter being smaller; applying [[Poiseuille's Law]] to the airways it is clear that airflow resistance through a tube is inversely related to the radius of the tube to the fourth power, therefore, decreases in airway results in significant flow impediments.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Lauren | last2 = Borger | first2 = Judith | title = Pediatric Bronchospasm | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546685/ | publisher = statPearls | date = June 26, 2020 | pmid = 31536291 | access-date = November 22, 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Signs and symptoms:
* Wheezing
* Diminished breath sounds
* Prolonged expiration
* Increase airway pressures (in ventilated patients)

==Treatment==

===Beta 2 agonists===

[[Beta2-adrenergic agonist]]s are recommended for bronchospasm.
* Short acting (SABA)
** [[Terbutaline]]
** [[Salbutamol]]
** [[Levosalbutamol]]
* Long acting ([[Long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist|LABA]])
** [[Formoterol]]
** [[Salmeterol]]
* Others
** [[Epinephrine]] - titrate to effect (e.g. 10-50 mcg IV), especially in setting of hemodynamic compromise
** increasing anesthetic depth
** IV magnesium
** Increase FiO2 to 100% and consider manual ventilation

===Muscarinic Acetylcholine receptor antagonist===
{{see also|Parasympathetic nervous system|Sympathetic nervous system}}

The [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] is known to decrease sympathetic response by slowing the heart rate and constricting the [[smooth muscle tissue]]. Ongoing research and successful clinical trials have shown that agents such as [[diphenhydramine]], [[atropine]] and [[Ipratropium bromide]] (all of which act as [[receptor antagonist]]s of [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s) are effective for treating asthma and COPD-related symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moulton |first1=Bart C |last2=Fryer |first2=Allison D |title=Muscarinic receptor antagonists, from folklore to pharmacology; finding drugs that actually work in asthma and COPD |journal=British Journal of Pharmacology |date=May 2011 |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=44–52 |doi=10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01190.x |url=https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2010.01190.x |language=en |issn=0007-1188|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="8193" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Cat allergy}}
'''Feline asthma''' is a common [[allergy|allergic]] respiratory disease in [[cat]]s, affecting at least one percent of all adult cats worldwide.  It is a chronic progressive disease for which there is no cure. Common symptoms include [[wheeze|wheezing]], [[cough]]ing, labored breathing and potentially life-threatening [[bronchoconstriction]]. There is conjecture that the disease has become more common due to increased exposure to industrial [[pollution|pollutants]]. Feline asthma can also be attributed to lung damage caused by long-term exposure to second-hand smoke.

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Cat Fluffy having a couching fit.webm|thumb|An adult cat having a coughing fit]] 
Feline asthma occurs with the [[inflammation]] of the small passageways of a cat's lungs. During the attack the lungs will thicken and constrict, making it difficult for the cat to breathe. [[Mucus]] may be released by the lungs into the airway, resulting in fits of coughing and wheezing. Some cats experience a less severe version of an asthma attack and only endure some slight coughing. The obvious signs that a [[cat]] is having a respiratory attack are: coughing, wheezing, blue lips and gums, squatting with shoulders hunched and neck extended, rapid open mouth breathing or gasping for air, gagging up foamy mucus, and overall weakness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=2017-10-16|title=Feline Asthma: What You Need To Know|url=https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/feline-asthma-what-you-need-know|access-date=2020-09-15|website=Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Owners often notice their cat coughing several times per day. Cat coughing sounds different from human coughing, usually sounding more like the cat is passing a [[hairball]]. [[veterinary physician|Veterinarians]] will classify the severity of feline asthma based on the medical signs. There are a number of [[disease]]s that are very closely related to feline asthma which must be ruled out before asthma can be diagnosed. [[Lungworm]]s, [[Dirofilaria immitis|heartworms]], upper and lower respiratory infections, [[lung cancer]], [[cardiomyopathy]] and lymphocytic plasmacytic stomatitis all mimic asthmatic symptoms. Medical signs, pulmonary radiographs, and a positive response to steroids help confirm the diagnosis.

While radiographs can be helpful for diagnosis, airway sampling through transtracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lavage is often necessary. More recently, computed tomography has been found to be more readily available and accurate in distinguishing feline tracheobronchitis from bronchopneumonia.

==Treatment==
Although feline asthma is incurable, ongoing treatments allow many domestic cats to live normal lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Feline Asthma Life Expectancy|url=http://www.vetinfo.com/feline-asthma-life-expectancy.html|access-date=2020-10-06|website=VetInfo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feline asthma is commonly managed through use of [[bronchodilators]] for mild cases, or [[glucocorticosteroids]] with bronchodilators for moderate to severe cases.

Previously, standard veterinary practice recommended injected and oral medications for control of the disease. These drugs may have systemic side effects including [[diabetes]] and [[pancreatitis]]. In 2000, Dr. Philip Padrid pioneered inhaled medications using a pediatric chamber and mask using [[fluticasone]] and [[salbutamol]]. Inhaled treatments reduce or eliminate systemic effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Treatment Instructions for Asthma and Bronchitis in Cats|url=http://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/treatment-instructions-for-asthma-and-bronchitis-in-cats|access-date=2020-10-06|website=vca_corporate|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Diagnosing and treating feline asthma (including the use of inhalants) (Proceedings)|url=https://www.dvm360.com/view/diagnosing-and-treating-feline-asthma-including-use-inhalants-proceedings|access-date=2020-10-06|website=DVM 360|date=August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 a chamber called the AeroKat Feline Aerosol Chamber was designed specifically for cats, significantly improving efficiency and reducing cost for the caregiver. Medicine can also be administered using a human baby spacer device.&lt;ref&gt;Homfray, Matthew, "Feline Asthma - Investigation and Treatment",  (2007, March 26). EzineArticles.com. Retrieved February 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Inhaled steroid usually takes 10–14 days to reach an effective dose.

==Prevention==
Feline asthma and other respiratory diseases may be prevented by cat owners by eliminating as many [[allergen]]s as possible. Allergens that can be found in a cat's habitual environment include: [[pollen]], [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s, dust from cat litter, perfumes, room fresheners, carpet deodorizers, hairspray, aerosol cleaners, cigarette smoke, and some foods. Avoid using cat litters that create excessive dust, scented cat litters or litter additives. Of course eliminating all of these can be difficult and unnecessary, especially since a cat is only affected by one or two. It can be very challenging to find the allergen that is creating asthmatic symptoms in a particular cat and requires a lot of work on both the owner's and the veterinarian's part. But just like any disease, the severity of an asthma attack can be propelled by more than just the allergens, common factors include: [[obesity]], [[stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Parasitism|parasites]] and pre-existing heart conditions. Dry air encourages asthma attacks so a humidifier, especially during winter months, is advised.

==Risk factors== 
Studies show that cats between the ages of two and eight years have the greatest risk of developing a respiratory disease.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}} Siamese and Himalayan breeds and [[breed]] mixes seem to be most prone to asthma.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}} Some studies also indicate that more female cats seem to be affected by asthma than male cats.{{Citation needed|date=July 2023}}

      <text bytes="21731" xml:space="preserve">Chronic [[Mycoplasma pneumonia|''Mycoplasma'' pneumonia]] and ''[[Chlamydia]]'' [[pneumonia]] infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of [[asthma]].&lt;ref name=Guilbert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guilbert|first=T.W|author2=Denlinger, L.C|title=Role of infection in the development and exacerbation of asthma|journal=Expert Rev. Respir. Med.|year=2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=71–83|doi=10.1586/ers.09.60|pmc=2840256|pmid=20305826}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway [[inflammation]], impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma. Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood. These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by [[respiratory syncytial virus]] (RSV) and human [[rhinovirus]] (HRV). Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age. HRV on the other hand is an important cause of [[bronchiolitis]] and is strongly associated with asthma development. In children and adults with established asthma, viral [[upper respiratory tract infections]] (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma. Thus, ''[[Chlamydia pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma.&lt;ref name=Guilbert /&gt;

==Asthma==
According to Hertzen (2002), a common characteristic of asthmatic patients is to have epithelial cells that respond to injury by enhancing the capability of producing proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines, instead of repairing the injured epithelial layer.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hertzen|first=L.V.|title=Role of persistent infection in the control and severity of asthma: focus on Chlamydia pneumoniae|journal=European Respiratory Journal|year=2002|volume=19|issue=3 |pages=546–556|doi=10.1183/09031936.02.00254402|pmid=11936537 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, inflammation and associated healing process leads to scar formation and tissue remodelling, which are symptoms that can be found in almost all asthmatics patients. Thus, asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Asthma is divided into two subgroups: atopic (extrinsic) and non-atopic (intrinsic). The atopic subgroup is closely associated with family history of the disease, whereas the non-atopic subgroup has its onset in adulthood and it is not caused by inheritance. It is known that non-atopic asthma has a more severe clinical course than atopic asthma. Non-atopic asthma may be caused by chronic viral, bacterial infections, or colonization with pathogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;

The distinction between atopic and non-atopic asthma is nuanced. "Atopic" is defined as having one or more positive skin tests to a battery of common aeroallergens, however, compared to people without asthma both atopic and non-atopic asthmatics have elevated levels of serum IgE (the "allergic" antibody) that is believed to be more directly responsible for asthma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burrows |first1=Benjamin |title=Association of asthma with serum IgE levels and skin-test reactivity to allergens |journal=N Engl J Med |date=1989 |volume=320 |issue=5 |pages=271–277 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198902023200502|pmid=2911321 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Herwerden |first1=L |title=Linkage of high-affinity IgE receptor gene with bronchial hyperreactivity, even in absence of atopy |journal=Lancet |date=1995 |volume=346 |issue=8985 |pages=1262–1265 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(95)91863-9|pmid=7475718 |s2cid=15952183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent meta-analysis reported that the overall population attributable risk for ''C. pneumoniae''-specific IgE in chronic asthma was 47% and was strongly and positively associated with disease severity.&lt;ref name="Chlamydia pneumoniae and chronic as"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hahn |first1=DL |title=Chlamydia pneumoniae and chronic asthma: Updated systematic review and meta-analysis of population attributable risk |journal=PLOS ONE |date=2021 |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=e0250034 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0250034|pmid=33872336 | pmc=8055030 |bibcode=2021PLoSO..1650034H |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Population-attributable risk is the proportion of disease that is potentially attributable to the risk factor under investigation, indicating the potential for infection with this "stealth pathogen" as a significant contributor to asthma incidence and prevalence.

''Chlamydophila pneumoniae'', formerly known as ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'', is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Chlamydiae, order Chlamydiales, and genus ''Chlamydophila''.&lt;ref name=Coombes2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coombes|first=Brain K|title=Cellular and Molecular Host-pathogen Interactions during Chlamydia Pneumoniae Infection|journal=Open Access Dissertations and Theses |id=Paper 1391.|year=2002|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/opendissertations/1391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is rod-shaped and Gram-negative.&lt;ref name=Coombes2 /&gt;  It has a characteristic pear-shaped elementary body (EB) that is surrounded by a periplasmic space, which makes it morphologically distinct from the round EBs of ''C. trachomatis'' and ''C. psittaci''.&lt;ref name=Kou7&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kou|first=C.C|author2=Jackson, L.A.|author3=Campbell, L.A.|author4=Grayston, J.T|title=Chlamydia pneumoniae|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews |year=1995|volume=8|issue=4|pages=451–461|pmid=8665464|doi=10.1128/CMR.8.4.451-461.1995|pmc=172870}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''C. pneumoniae'' is non-motile and utilizes aerobic respiration. As an obligate intracellular bacterium, ''C. pneumoniae'' is both parasitic and mesophilic.&lt;ref name=Kou7 /&gt;

====Biological interactions with host====
''C. pneumoniae'' is able to grow in monocytes, macrophages, endothelial and smooth muscle cells.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  It replicates within the host cell cytoplasm. Due to the fact that it does not have the ability to synthesize its own ATP, it is entirely dependent on energy produced by their host.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Larsen12&gt;{{cite web|last=Larsen, R.|first=Pogliano, K.|title=Chlamydophila pneumoniae|url=http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Chlamydophila_pneumoniae|publisher=Microbe Wiki|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Reinfection of the host with ''C. pneumoniae'' is common because the memory immunity elicited by ''C. pneumoniae'' is short-lived and partial.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt; In addition, ''C. pneumoniae'' infection tends to be persistence due to IFN-γ, penicillin and nutrient deficiencies.&lt;ref name=Beatty1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beatty|first=WL|author2=Morrison, RP.|author3=Byrne, G.|title=Persistent Chlamydiae: from cell culture to a paradigm for chlamydial pathogenesis|journal=Microbiological Reviews|year=1994|volume=58|issue=4 |pages=686–699|doi=10.1128/mr.58.4.686-699.1994 |pmc=372987|pmid=7854252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These deficiencies prevent ''C.pneumoniae'' from completing their normal developmental cycle, leading to the formation of aberrant, noninfectious ''C. pneumoniae'' that persist in the human host.&lt;ref name=Beatty1 /&gt;  C. pneumonia infection may not only be persistent and chronic, but it also has irreversible tissue injury and scarring processes,&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt; which are symptoms in asthma patients. Infection with ''C. pneumoniae'' induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  Among the two immune responses, cell-mediated immune response that involves CD8+ T cells in particular is crucial to eradicate ''C. pneumoniae'', whereas the humoral immune response appears to be rather ineffective in protection against C. pneumonia infection.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  In fact, CD8+ T cells are so important that if it is absent in the host, the C. pneumonia infection would progress rapidly. Although cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the clearance of ''C. pneumoniae'', this response can be harmful to the host because it favours the development of inflammation that can lead to asthma.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;

====Roles in asthma====
There is a strong association of ''C. pneumoniae'' with long-standing asthma among the non-atopic asthma in comparison to atopic asthma.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  In fact, the severity of asthma can be determined by the elevated titres to ''C. pneumoniae'', but not to other potential pathogens such as ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'', adenovirus, influenza A and B or parainfluenza virus.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  It is hypothesized that ''C. pneumoniae'' is associated with asthma because ''C. pneumoniae'' has been found to cause ciliostasis in bronchial epithelial cells.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  Meanwhile, sero-epidemiological data also provide evidences to support that ''C. pneumoniae'' plays a role in asthma by amplifying inflammation and inciting the disease process.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  The association of ''C. pneumoniae'' and asthma begins with ''C. pneumoniae'' producing 60-kDa heat shock proteins that provide a prolonged antigenic stimulation.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  This particular heat shock protein is known as a member of hsp60 family of stress proteins, which can be found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The production of hsp60 remains unaltered even when ''C. pneumoniae'' is dormant and does not replicate, since that hsp60 serves as a protective antigen.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  Its antigenic stimulation strongly amplifies chronic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ by infected cells, which ultimately leads to immunopathological tissue damage and scarring in the asthmatic lungs.&lt;ref name=Hertzen5 /&gt;  Furthermore, infection with ''C. pneumonia'' also induces serum immunoglobulin IgA, and IgG responses, which are associated with chronic asthma.&lt;ref name=Kou7 /&gt; Most strikingly, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that ''C. pneumoniae''-specific IgE was associated with almost half of the asthma cases studied.&lt;ref name="Chlamydia pneumoniae and chronic as"/&gt; Lastly, a growing body of evidence from animal model studies finds that ''C. pneumoniae'' infection not only creates the "asthma phenotype" but also induces previously non-allergic animals to display allergic responses to exogenous (i.e., non-chlamydial) allergens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Webley |first1=WC |title=Infection-mediated asthma: etiology, mechanisms and treatment options, with focus on Chlamydia pneumoniae and macrolides |journal=Respir Res |date=2017 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=98 |doi=10.1186/s12931-017-0584-z|pmid=28526018 |pmc=5437656 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====General descriptions====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mycoplasma pneumoniae.gif]] --&gt;

''M. pneumoniae'' is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Mollicutes, order Mycoplasmatales and family Mycoplasmataceae.&lt;ref name=Pasternak11&gt;{{cite web|last=Pasternak|first=Y.|title=Mycoplasma pneumoniae|url=http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Mycoplasma_pneumoniae|publisher=Microbe Wiki|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is either filamentous or spherical. Individual spindle-shaped cells of ''M. pneumoniae'' are 1 to 2&amp;nbsp;µm long and 0.1 to 0.2&amp;nbsp;µm wide.&lt;ref name=Pasternak11 /&gt;  ''M. pneumoniae'' is a motile, mesophilic bacterium that exhibits obligate aerobic respiration. It is an extracellular, host-associated bacterium that lacks a cell wall&lt;ref name=Waites10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waites|first=K.B.|author2=Talkington, D.|title=Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Its Role as a Human Pathogen|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|year=2004|pages=697–728|pmid=15489344|doi=10.1128/CMR.17.4.697-728.2004|volume=17|issue=4 |pmc=523564}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is unable to survive outside of a host due to osmotic instability in the environment.

====Biological interactions with host====
''M. pneumoniae'' can cause infections in humans, animals, plants, and cell cultures. It is a parasitic bacterium that invades the mucosal membranes of the upper and lower respiratory tract, including nasopharynx, throat, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.&lt;ref name=Waites10 /&gt;  In order to survive, ''M. pneumoniae'' needs essential nutrients and compounds such as amino acids, cholesterol, precursors to nucleic acid synthesis, and fatty acids obtained from the mucosal epithelial cells of the host.&lt;ref name=Pasternak11 /&gt;  Its adhesion proteins attach to tracheal epithelial cells by sialoglycoproteins or sialoglycolipid receptors, which are located on its cell surface.&lt;ref name=Pasternak11 /&gt;  It may cause injury to the respiratory epithelial cell after its attachment. The injury of host epithelial cells caused by ''M. pneumoniae'' adhesion is thought to be due to the production of highly reactive species: hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and superoxide radicals (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=Pasternak11 /&gt;  ''M. pneumoniae'' has the potential for intracellular localization. The intracellular existence of ''M. pneumoniae'' could facilitate the establishment of latent or chronic states, circumvent mycoplasmacidal immune mechanisms, its ability to cross mucosal barriers and gain access to internal tissues. Besides, fusion of the mycoplasmal cell membrane with that of the host not only results in the release of various hydrolytic enzymes produced by the ''mycoplasma'', but also leads to the insertion of mycoplasmal membrane components into the host cell membrane, a process that could potentially alter receptor recognition sites and affect cytokine induction and expression.&lt;ref name=Waites10 /&gt;  As stated by Nisar et al. (2007), ''M. pneumonia'' can persist in the respiratory tract up to several months after recovery from acute pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Nisar9&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisar|first=N.|author2=Guleria, R.|author3=Kuma, S. r.|author4=Chawla, T. C.|author5=Biswas, N. R.|title=Mycoplasma pneumoniae and its role in asthma|journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal|year=2007|pages=100–104|doi=10.1136/pgmj.2006.049023|volume=83|issue=976 |pmc=2805928|pmid=17308212}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, ''M. pneumonia'' can be cultured from respiratory secretions even after the pneumonia patients are treated with effective antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Nisar9 /&gt;  Thus, M. pneumonia infection is chronic and persistent. Besides, Nisar et al. (2007) also adds that M. pneumonia infection causes pulmonary structural abnormalities, resulting in a decrease in expiratory flow rates and an increase in airways hyper-responsiveness in non-asthmatic individuals.&lt;ref name=Nisar9 /&gt;

====Roles in asthma====
M. pneumonia infection is responsible for triggering exacerbation of asthma in 3.3 to 50% in such cases.&lt;ref name=Nisar9 /&gt;  Furthermore, ''M. pneumonia'' may also precede the onset of asthma, because patients with an acute infection by ''M. pneumonia'', followed by the development of asthma, have significant improvement in lung function and asthma symptoms after they are given antimicrobial treatment against ''M. pneumonia''. The release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to M. pneumoniae infection has been indicated as a possible mechanism leading to bronchial asthma.&lt;ref name=Waites10 /&gt;  This is because the increase of cytokine production results in a continuing inflammatory response in the airway, followed by negative effects such as immunopathological tissue damage and scarring as described in the ''C. pneumonia''’s role in asthma section. Furthermore, patients with asthma are found to have an increased release of type II cytokines, especially IL4 and IL5, but a normal or low level of type I cytokine production. Similarly, M. pneumoniae infection promotes a T helper type 2 response, which is why ''M pneumoniae''-positive patients with asthma have increased airways expression of tumour necrosis factor a, IL4 and IL5. The T helper type 2 predominant airways disease caused by M. pneumonia infection may lead to IgE-related hyper-responsiveness and eosinophil function, resulting in an onset of asthma.&lt;ref name=Nisar9 /&gt;  There is also a possibility that M. pneumoniae infection may destroy respiratory mucosal cells and facilitate the penetration of antigens into the mucosa.&lt;ref name=Nisar9 /&gt;  A study done by Laitinen et al. (1976) suggests that M. pneumoniae infection denude the epithelial surface and expose irritant receptors.&lt;ref name=Laitinen8&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laitinen|first=LA |author2=Elkin, RB. |author3=Jacobs, L.|title=Changes in bronchial reactivity after administration of live attenuated influenza virus|journal=Am. Rev. Respir. Dis.|year=1976|pages=194–198|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On top of that, ''M. pneumoniae'' induces the activation of mast cells by releasing serotonin and hexosaminidase.&lt;ref name=Waites10 /&gt;  By producing antigen, ''M. pneumonia'' is capable of initiating an antibody response. Its antigen interacts with IgE that attaches to mast cells, leading to the stimulation of histamine release followed by airway obstruction.&lt;ref name=Nisar9 /&gt;

===Human rhinoviruses (HRVs)===
{{main|Human rhinovirus}}

====General descriptions====
[[File:Human rhinovirus.jpg]]

Rhinoviruses are known to be the most important common cold viruses.&lt;ref name=Jack6&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jack Merrit Gwaltney|first=J.|title=Medical Reviews Rhinoviruses|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |year=1975|pages=17–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are ssRNA positive-strand viruses with no DNA stage, and are classified within the family Picornaviridae.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;  Rhinoviruses are small, with the length of approximately 30&amp;nbsp;nm, and do not contain an envelope.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;  Their icosahedral capsids contain 4 proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2, and VP3 are located on the surface of the capsid and are responsible for the antigenic diversity of Rhinoviruses.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;  In contrast, VP4 is located inside the virus and its function is to anchor the RNA core to the viral capsid.&lt;ref name=Friedlander3&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedlander|first=S. L.|title=The role of rhinovirus in asthma exacerbations|journal=J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.|year=2005|volume=116|issue=2|pages=267–273|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2005.06.003|pmid=16083778 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While sharing basic properties with enteroviruses, such as size, shape, nucleic acid composition, and ether-resistance, rhinoviruses are distinguished from enteroviruses by having a greater buoyant density and a susceptibility to inactivation if they are exposed to an acidic environment.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;  Nevertheless, they share a common ancestor with enteroviruses.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;

====Biological interactions with host====
The optimal temperature for rhinovirus replication is 33-35&amp;nbsp;°C, which corresponds to the temperature of nasal mucosa. At 37&amp;nbsp;°C virus replication rate falls to 10% to 50% of optimum.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;  This may be the major reason why rhinoviruses can replicate better in the nasal passages and upper tracheobronchial tree than in the lower respiratory tract.&lt;ref name=Rhino13&gt;{{cite web|title=Rhinovirus|url=http://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Rhinovirus|publisher=Microbe Wiki|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the rhinovirus serotypes bind to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), whereas approximately 10% of the serotypes bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor.&lt;ref name=Rhino13 /&gt;  Normally, rhinoviruses would infect small clusters of cells in the epithelial layer with little cellular cytotoxicity.&lt;ref name=Rhino13 /&gt;  Although an increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils are shown in infected nasal epithelium, little or no mucosal damage occurs from the infection.&lt;ref name=Friedlander3 /&gt;  Nevertheless, rhinovirus infection leads to symptoms of the common cold, which is primarily an upper airway illness.&lt;ref name=Friedlander3 /&gt;  Rhinovirus receptors are insensitive to neuraminidase but are sensitive to proteolytic enzymes.&lt;ref name=Jack6 /&gt;

====Roles in asthma ====
Asthmatic subjects in 9 to 11 years old, 80% to 85% of asthma exacerbations that were associated with reduced peak expiratory flow rates and wheezing were due to viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). High rates of asthma attacks due to rhinovirus infection are also found in adults.&lt;ref name=Friedlander3 /&gt;  It turns out that rhinovirus are capable of inducing epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines that result in airway hyperresponsiveness, neurogenic inflammatory responses, mucous secretion, inflammatory cell recruitment and activation, and plasma leakage. To support this statement, asthmatic subjects that are infected with rhinovirus have demonstrated an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness, airway obstruction, and inflammation. Similarly, rhinovirus infection has caused subjects with allergic rhinitis but no history of asthma to have a significantly increased airway hyperreactivity as well as a significantly increased incidence of late asthmatic reactions. This shows that in addition to causing airway hyperreactivity, rhinovirus also promotes the onset of non-atopic asthma.&lt;ref name=Friedlander3 /&gt;  Furthermore, rhinovirus infection also promotes eosinophil recruitment to airway segments after antigen challenges, and thus intensifies airway inflammatory response to antigens, leading to the development of asthma.

=== Canada ===
Data depicts an increasing trend in asthma prevalence among Canada's population. In 2000-2001 asthma prevalence was monitored at 6.5%; by 2010-2011 a 4.3% increase was shown, with asthma prevalence totaling 10.8% of Canada's population.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/asthma-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-canada-2018.html#a1.2|title=Asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Canada, 2018|last1=Canada|first1=Public Health Agency of|date=2018-05-01|website=aem|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, asthma prevalence varies among the provinces of Canada; the highest prevalence is Ontario at 12.1%, and the lowest is Nunavut at 3.8%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Though there is an overall decrease in the incidence of new asthma cases in Canada, prevalence is rising. This can be attributed to a decrease in case-specific mortality due to improved management and control of asthma and its symptoms.

=== Latin and Central America ===
It is approximated that 40 million Latin Americans live with asthma.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In some reports, urban residency within Latin America has been found to be associated with an increased prevalence of asthma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forno E, Gogna M, Cepeda A, Yañez A, Solé D, Cooper P, Avila L, Soto-Quiros M, Castro-Rodriguez JA, Celedón JC | title = Asthma in Latin America | journal = Thorax | volume = 70 | issue = 9 | pages = 898–905 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26103996 | pmc = 4593416 | doi = 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2015-207199 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood asthma prevalence was found to be higher than 15 percent in a majority of Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mallol J, Solé D, Baeza-Bacab M, Aguirre-Camposano V, Soto-Quiros M, Baena-Cagnani C | title = Regional variation in asthma symptom prevalence in Latin American children | journal = The Journal of Asthma | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 644–50 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20642377 | doi = 10.3109/02770901003686480 | s2cid = 23993282 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study published relating to asthma prevalence in Havana, Cuba estimated that approximately 9 percent of children under the age of 15 are undiagnosed for asthma, possible due to lack of resources in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Japan ===
The prevalence of asthma in adults in Japan is rapidly increasing, however there is a significant difference for the children in Japan. The mean prevalence of asthma in Japan has increased from about 1% to 10% or higher in children and to about 6–10% in adults since the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-04-01|title=Japanese guidelines for adult asthma 2017|journal=Allergology International|language=en|volume=66|issue=2|pages=163–189|doi=10.1016/j.alit.2016.12.005|issn=1323-8930|last1=Ichinose|first1=Masakazu|last2=Sugiura|first2=Hisatoshi|last3=Nagase|first3=Hiroyuki|last4=Yamaguchi|first4=Masao|last5=Inoue|first5=Hiromasa|last6=Sagara|first6=Hironori|last7=Tamaoki|first7=Jun|last8=Tohda|first8=Yuji|last9=Munakata|first9=Mitsuru|last10=Yamauchi|first10=Kohei|last11=Ohta|first11=Ken|author12=Japanese Society of Allergology|pmid=28196638|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a 1.5 fold increase in the prevalence of asthma per decade in Japan from the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Three surveys done from 1985, 1999 and 2006 show adult asthma is increasing, while the same surveys indicate that the prevalence of asthma in children is decreasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iwanaga|first1=Takashi|last2=Tohda|first2=Yuji|date=October 2016|title=Epidemiology of asthma in Japan|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551268/|journal=Nihon Rinsho.

=== Asia ===
Data regarding the epidemiology of asthma in the continent of Asia as whole is scarce, particularly regarding adult populations. However, similarly to much of the rest of the globe, prevalence of childhood asthma appears to be rising. Systematic childhood studies, such as the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), provide data regarding the epidemiology of asthma among Asia's youth population. Asthma prevalence among Asia's adult population is less clear in comparison due to the comparatively higher monitoring of younger populations. However, the data available points to a positive correlation between age and asthma prevalence. Findings indicate that the prevalence of asthma among the Asian adult population is less than 5%; while findings pertaining to elderly populations illustrate a rate somewhere between 1.3 and 15.3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song WJ, Kang MG, Chang YS, Cho SH | title = Epidemiology of adult asthma in Asia: toward a better understanding | journal = Asia Pacific Allergy | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 75–85 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24809012 | pmc = 4005350 | doi = 10.5415/apallergy.2014.4.2.75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International migration===
In a review of studies on the prevalence of asthma among migrant populations, those born in high-income countries were found to have higher rates of asthma than migrants. Second-generation migrants had a higher risk of asthma than first-generation migrants, and the prevalence of asthma increases with longer time of residence in the host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cabieses |first1=B |title=A Systematic Review on the Development of Asthma and Allergic Diseases in Relation to International Immigration: The Leading Role of the Environment Confirmed |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=e105347 |date=2014 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0105347|pmid=25141011 |pmc=4139367 |bibcode=2014PLoSO...9j5347C |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms the role of the environment in the development of asthma.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

=== Regional differences ===
A survey conducted by the ISSAC Steering Committee conducted a study from 1992 to 1993 in adults aged 22 to 44 comparing the prevalence of asthma in 10 developed countries. An important note to consider is the population differences between these countries. The United States population in 1992 was 256.9 million, 14.5 times that of Australia (17.5 mil), and 4.5 times of the United Kingdom (57.51 mil).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Bureau|first=US Census|title=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1992|url=https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1992/compendia/statab/112ed.html|access-date=2020-12-03|website=The United States Census Bureau|language=EN-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Population, total - Australia {{!}} Data|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=AU|access-date=2020-12-03|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Population, total - United Kingdom {{!}} Data|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=GB|access-date=2020-12-03|website=data.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Australia and the UK have a higher prevalence than the US by 2.4 times on the lower end and 4.6 times on the higher end.

Large urban can be classified as the inner-city, and small urban is related to suburban areas. The inner city and rural communities have several commonalities that are important when determining socioeconomic status. They are both more likely to have higher poverty rates, and higher mortality rates, thus having a lower health status than suburban residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Susan J.|last2=Kagen|first2=Jessica|date=2002-01-02|title=The Effects of Socioeconomic Status on Health in Rural and Urban America|url=https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.1.109-JMS0102-3-1|journal=JAMA|volume=287|issue=1|pages=109|doi=10.1001/jama.287.1.109-JMS0102-3-1|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that asthma prevalence in large urban areas was 20.9%, small urban was 21.5%, and rural was 15.1%. However, it is important to acknowledge that rural residents experienced more asthma-like symptoms (wheezing, whistling, and coughing) than those in urban areas, rural residents had 5% more asthma like symptoms.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Also, residents in large urban areas were less likely to use medical services for asthma symptoms.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Multiple factors contribute to socioeconomic disparities, income and education, pollutant exposures and allergens are uncontrollable influences on an individual. Stressors related to neighborhood violence and safety, behavioral risk factors, and lack of access to adequate medications and healthcare also contribute to an increased prevalence of asthma. Low income alone accounts for a significant increase in poor asthma outcomes, including severity, lung function, and morbidity rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cardet|first1=Juan Carlos|last2=Louisias|first2=Margee|last3=King|first3=Tonya S.|last4=Castro|first4=Mario|last5=Codispoti|first5=Christopher D.|last6=Dunn|first6=Ryan|last7=Engle|first7=Linda|last8=Giles|first8=B.

Secondhand smoke is a common exposure for asthmatic children in low-income households.

=== Gender ===
Globally, there are 136 million women with asthma, 57% of the 235 million people living with asthma. In addition to being more common among women, women experience more severe symptoms and are more likely to die from asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Asthma and Lung UK report - Asthma is worse for women (27 April 2022) |url=https://www.pslhub.org/learn/patient-safety-in-health-and-care/womens-health/asthma-and-lung-uk-report-asthma-is-worse-for-women-27-april-2022-r6694/ |access-date=2022-05-12 |website=Patient Safety Learning - the hub |date=27 April 2022 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The severity and frequency of asthma complications is related to both gender and age. Although asthma is more prevalent and more severe in boys among children, many women experience a significant worsening of symptoms around and after puberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Shah |first1=Ruchi |last2=Newcomb |first2=Dawn C. |date=2018 |title=Sex Bias in Asthma Prevalence and Pathogenesis |journal=Frontiers in Immunology |volume=9 |page=2997 |doi=10.3389/fimmu.2018.02997 |pmid=30619350 |pmc=6305471 |issn=1664-3224|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The timing of the change in prevalence and severity around puberty suggest that asthma pathogenesis is related to sex hormones or hormone levels.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

Between 2014-15 and 2019-20 more than 5,100 women in the United Kingdom died from an asthma attack compared with fewer than 2,300 men. Based on emergency hospital admissions in England, among all admissions 20 to 49 years old, women were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for asthma treatment compared with men.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

==Background==
The avoidance of [[asthma]] [[Asthma trigger|triggers]] and/or [[allergens]] has been recognised by many clinicians and researchers as being an integral part of an asthma management plan.&lt;ref&gt;Walshaw and Evans, Q J Med, 1986{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Capristo et al, Allergy, 2004{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platts-Mills, NEJM, 2003{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;O'Connor, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2005{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgan et al, NEJM, 2004{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been some discussion as to whether [[dust mite]] avoidance measures will result in a clinically relevant outcome&lt;ref&gt;Gotzsche, Lancet, 2007{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock et al, NEJM, 2003{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Platts-Mills, J Allergy Clin Immunol, 2008{{Full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resulting debate has given rise to a recommendation by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute]] that an asthma management plan should include avoidance of as many allergens as possible to which the individual is sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Third International Workshop. JACI vol. 100: no.6, part 1&lt;/ref&gt; This report and others&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; also assert that no single specific measure is sufficient to reduce allergens: An allergen reduction plan, which encompasses a variety of approaches is necessary to address management of asthma symptoms.

==Certification mark==
''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly'' is a registered certification mark operated by Allergy Standards Limited&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com Allergy Standards.&lt;/ref&gt; in association with not-for-profit asthma and/or allergy organizations in the country of operation. Products are subjected to standardised testing and if they pass, are deemed ''Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly''. The Asthma &amp; Allergy Friendly Certification Program has been implemented in a number of countries, such as: 
* The United States (in association with the [[Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America]]), 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:US-General-mark.jpg|asthma &amp; allergy friendly US mark
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Canada (in association with [[Asthma Canada]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asthma.ca/adults/ asthma.ca/adults/ "Asthma Canada"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213004323/http://asthma.ca/adults/ |date=2009-02-13 }}. asthma.ca Asthma Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Canada general-mark.jpg|asthma &amp; allergy friendly Canadian mark
&lt;/gallery&gt;
* Internationally (operated by Allergy Standards&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com Allergy Standards.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The allergen [[immunoassay]] sampling and analysis for the certification program is carried out by various accredited partner laboratories such as Berkeley Analytical, [[Testex]] and Airmid Healthgroup specialised in environmental testings and in particular for allergy and asthma, [[microbiology]], [[molecular biology]], and [[aerobiology]]. Testing is conducted at a uniquely integrated testing facility which combines molecular biology, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ([[ELISA]]) with state of the art air sampling and particle counting in a highly sophisticated [[Environmental test chambers|environmental test chamber]] facility with a microbiological aerosol capability.

==Certification process==
=== Overview of the standards ===
Standards assess products for the presence of allergenic dyes and sensitizing chemicals&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26708986_Chemical_allergens-What_are_the_issues “Chemical Allergens-What Are the Issues?”]. Kimber, Ian, David A. Basketter, and Rebecca J. Dearman. 2010. “Chemical Allergens-What Are the Issues?” Toxicology 268(3): 139–42. access-date=2018-08-28 &lt;/ref&gt;  as well as the capacity for allergen retention and ability to withstand eradication techniques such as repeated washing machine cycles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:6330:ed-3:v1:en "ISO 6330:2012(en) Textiles — Domestic washing and drying procedures for textile testing"]. iso.org &lt;/ref&gt; Product areas that have been certified include textile materials, electrical appliances, building products and kids toys.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.asthmaandallergyfriendly.com/INT/certified-products "Certified Products"]. asthmaandallergyfriendly.com &lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Prerequisites ===
Products seeking to be certified ''asthma &amp; allergy friendly'' must pass Allergy Standards rigorous testing standards.  Manufacturers must submit their products for testing to Allergy Standards Ltd approved third party laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;[https://berkeleyanalytical.com  "Berkeley Analytical"]. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.airmidhealthgroup.com  "Airmid Health Group"]. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ibr-usa.com   "IBR USA"]. &lt;/ref&gt; Products must be submitted from current production and consumer ready. In order to pass the standards, products must meet the criteria of the standard relevant to the product category. 

=== Laboratory tests ===
Certification standards are tailored to the specific product categories. Criteria in the standards may include low or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, free from banned dyes and allergens according to best international practice,&lt;ref&gt;[https://echa.europa.eu/home "European Chemicals Agency"]. &lt;/ref&gt; and capable of either providing a barrier to allergens or effectively removing allergen from the environment. Importantly, products must also demonstrate that they are capable of carrying out their function effectively and are of acceptable quality and construction. For example textiles must be evaluated for barrier function, but must also demonstrate barrier function after washing.  Vacuum cleaners must demonstrate effective allergen removal, but this is also assessed when the bag is near capacity, demonstrating no significant loss of power and no redistribution of dust and allergens.

==Allergy Standards Limited==
Allergy Standards Limited is an International Standards and Certification Body that prepares independent standards for a wide range of products to declare their suitability for people whose lives are affected by allergies and asthma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allergystandards.com "Allergy Standards"]. allergystandards.com Allergy Standards Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Their headquarters are based in Dublin, Ireland. 

Allergy Standards published a white paper on Allergens and Irritants in Household Cleaning Products in the Household and Personal Care Today peer reviewed journal&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allergystandards.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Allergens-and-Cleaning-Products-Dr-Joey-DeCourcey-Allergy-Standards.pdf “Allergens and irritants in household cleaning products. Clinical testing for triggers of asthma and allergies”]. DR JOSEPH DECOURCEY. 2018. “H&amp;PC Today - Household and Personal Care Today - vol. 13(6) November/December 2018 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text bytes="3148" xml:space="preserve">'''Creola bodies''' are a [[histopathologic]] finding indicative of [[asthma]].  Found in a patient's [[sputum]], they are ciliated columnar cells sloughed from the [[bronchial]] mucosa of a patient with asthma.  Other common findings in the sputum of asthma patients include [[Charcot-Leyden crystals]], [[Curschmann's Spirals]], and [[eosinophils]] (and excessive amounts of sputum).

Yoshihara et al. reported 60% of pediatric asthmatic patients demonstrating acute symptoms were found to have creola bodies in their sputum. These patients had increased levels of [[neutrophil]]-mediated [[cytokine]] activity concluding that "epithelial damage is associated with a locally enhanced chemotactic signal for and activity of neutrophils, but not eosinophils, during acute exacerbations of paediatric asthma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03058.x |pmid=16634793 |pmc=1809654 |title=Association of epithelial damage and signs of neutrophil mobilization in the airways during acute exacerbations of paediatric asthma |journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology |volume=144 |issue=2 |pages=212–216 |year=2006 |last1=Yoshihara |first1=S. |last2=Yamada |first2=Y. |last3=Abe |first3=T. |last4=Linden |first4=A. |last5=Arisaka |first5=O. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ogata et al. found significant correlations among the CrB score, the concentration of sputum ECP and %FEV1.0 (p less than 0.001). The CrB score on the day of clinical appraisal significantly correlated with the number 6f days of treatment needed for remission. These results were in keeping with the hypothesis that eosinophils cause desquamation of respiratory epithelial cells resulting in prolongation of asthmatic attacks. Observation of CrB seemed to be useful as a marker of duration of asthmatic attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.15036/arerugi.39.1567 |pmid=2096802 |title=急性喘息発作時におけるCreola Bodyと喀痰中Eosinophil Cationic Proteinの関係およびその臨床的意義 |language=Japanese |trans-title=Creola bodies and the eosinophil cationic protein in sputum in acute asthmatic attacks with respect to their clinical significance |journal=Arerugi |volume=39 |issue=12 |pages=1567–75 |year=1990 |last1=Ogata |first1=Hidetsugu |last2=Motojima |first2=Shinji |last3=Fukuda |first3=Takeshi |last4=Makino |first4=Sohei }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nitric-oxide-2D.png|thumb|Chemical formula of nitric oxide (NO) together with its molecular size (115 [[picometer|pm]]).]]
In [[medicine]], '''exhaled nitric oxide''' (eNO) can be measured in a [[breath test]] for [[asthma]] and other [[Respiratory disease|respiratory conditions]] characterized by [[airway]] [[inflammation]]. [[Nitric oxide]] (NO) is a gaseous [[molecule]] produced by certain [[Cell (biology)|cell]] types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FE&lt;sub&gt;NO&lt;/sub&gt;) is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma. The breath test has recently become available in many well-equipped hospitals in developed countries, although its exact role remains unclear.

[[Image:Nitric-oxide-3D-vdW.png|thumb|Three-dimensional model of NO.]]
In humans, nitric oxide is produced from [[L-arginine]] by three [[enzymes]] called [[nitric oxide synthase]]s (NOS): inducible (iNOS), endothelial ([[Endothelial NOS|eNOS]]), and neuronal (nNOS). The latter two are constantly active in [[endothelial cell]]s and [[neuron]]s respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by [[cytokines]]). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including [[eosinophils]]. As such, eNO (also known as FeNO "fractional exhaled nitric oxide") has been dubbed an ''inflammometer''.&lt;ref name="pmid18076708"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pijnenburg MW, De Jongste JC | title = Exhaled nitric oxide in childhood asthma: a review | journal = Clinical and Experimental Allergy | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 246–59 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18076708 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02897.x | s2cid = 12409719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was initially thought that exhaled NO derived mostly from the sinuses, which contain high levels of NO. It has subsequently been shown that the lower airways contribute most of the exhaled NO, and that contamination from the sinuses is minimal.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

===Asthma===
Patients with [[asthma]] have higher eNO levels than other people. Their levels also rise together with other clinical and laboratory parameters of asthma (for example, the amount of [[eosinophils]] in their [[sputum]]). In conditions that trigger inflammation such as [[upper respiratory tract infection]]s or the inhalation of [[allergen]]s or [[plicatic acid]], eNO levels rise.&lt;ref name="pmid16750986"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vahlkvist S, Sinding M, Skamstrup K, Bisgaard H | title = Daily home measurements of exhaled nitric oxide in asthmatic children during natural birch pollen exposure | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 117 | issue = 6 | pages = 1272–6 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16750986 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2006.03.018 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10232414"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Obata H, Dittrick M, Chan H, Chan-Yeung M | title = Sputum eosinophils and exhaled nitric oxide during late asthmatic reaction in patients with western red cedar asthma | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 489–95 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10232414 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.99.13348999 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The eNO levels also tend to vary according to the results of lung function test results such as the degree of [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness]]. Furthermore, drugs used to treat asthma (such as inhaled [[glucocorticoids]] or [[leukotriene receptor antagonist]]s) also reduce eNO levels.

[[Clinical trial]]s have looked at whether tailoring asthma therapy based on eNO values is better than conventional care, in which therapy is gauged by symptoms and the results of lung function tests.&lt;ref name="pmid15914548"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith AD, Cowan JO, Brassett KP, Herbison GP, Taylor DR | s2cid = 42351261 | title = Use of exhaled nitric oxide measurements to guide treatment in chronic asthma | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 352 | issue = 21 | pages = 2163–73 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15914548 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa043596 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17496226"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shaw DE, Berry MA, Thomas M, Green RH, Brightling CE, Wardlaw AJ, Pavord ID | s2cid = 22186959 | title = The use of exhaled nitric oxide to guide asthma management: a randomized controlled trial | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 176 | issue = 3 | pages = 231–7 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17496226 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200610-1427OC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18805335"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szefler SJ, Mitchell H, Sorkness CA, Gergen PJ, O'Connor GT, Morgan WJ, Kattan M, Pongracic JA, Teach SJ, Bloomberg GR, Eggleston PA, Gruchalla RS, Kercsmar CM, Liu AH, Wildfire JJ, Curry MD, Busse WW | display-authors = 6 | title = Management of asthma based on exhaled nitric oxide in addition to guideline-based treatment for inner-city adolescents and young adults: a randomised controlled trial | journal = Lancet | volume = 372 | issue = 9643 | pages = 1065–72 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18805335 | pmc = 2610850 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61448-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the results in both adults and children have been modest and this technique can not be universally recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petsky HL, Kew KM, Turner C, Chang AB | title = Exhaled nitric oxide levels to guide treatment for adults with asthma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2016 | pages = CD011440 | date = September 2016 | issue = 9 | pmid = 27580628 | pmc = 6457753 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011440.pub2 | editor-last = Cochrane Airways Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petsky HL, Kew KM, Chang AB | title = Exhaled nitric oxide levels to guide treatment for children with asthma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD011439 | date = November 2016 | issue = 5 | pmid = 27825189 | pmc = 6432844 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011439.pub2 | editor-last = Cochrane Airways Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted that factors other than inflammation can increase eNO levels, for example airway [[acidity]].&lt;ref name="pmid10712309"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hunt JF, Fang K, Malik R, Snyder A, Malhotra N, Platts-Mills TA, Gaston B | title = Endogenous airway acidification.

The fraction of eNO has been found to be a better test to identify asthmatics than basic lung function testing (for airway obstruction).

==Other conditions==
The role for eNO in other conditions is even less well established compared to asthma.

Since asthma can be a cause of [[chronic cough]]ing (it may even be the sole manifestation, such as in [[cough-variant asthma]]), studies have looked at whether eNO can be used in the diagnosis of chronic cough.&lt;ref name="pmid18399857"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fujimura M, Ohkura N, Abo M, Furusho S, Waseda Y, Ichikawa Y, Hara J | title = Exhaled nitric oxide levels in patients with atopic cough and cough variant asthma | journal = Respirology | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 359–64 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18399857 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2008.01273.x | hdl = 2297/9771 | s2cid = 19895759 | url = https://kanazawa-u.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=repository_uri&amp;item_id=13203 | hdl-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18583518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oh MJ, Lee JY, Lee BJ, Choi DC | title = Exhaled nitric oxide measurement is useful for the exclusion of nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis in patients with chronic cough | journal = Chest | volume = 134 | issue = 5 | pages = 990–995 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18583518 | doi = 10.1378/chest.07-2541 | url = http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18583518 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20130415002912/http://www.chestjournal.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18583518 | archive-date = 2013-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18614345"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sato S, Saito J, Sato Y, Ishii T, Xintao W, Tanino Y, Ishida T, Munakata M | display-authors = 6 | title = Clinical usefulness of fractional exhaled nitric oxide for diagnosing prolonged cough | journal = Respiratory Medicine | volume = 102 | issue = 10 | pages = 1452–9 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18614345 | doi = 10.1016/j.rmed.2008.04.018 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17976354"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hahn PY, Morgenthaler TY, Lim KG | title = Use of exhaled nitric oxide in predicting response to inhaled corticosteroids for chronic cough | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 82 | issue = 11 | pages = 1350–5 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17976354 | doi = 10.4065/82.11.1350 | url = http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/Abstract.asp?AID=4509&amp;Abst=Abstract&amp;UID= | archive-url = https://archive.today/20070701134914/http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/Abstract.asp?AID=4509&amp;Abst=Abstract&amp;UID= | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2007-07-01 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Exhaled NO is minimally increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but levels may rise in sudden worsenings of the disease ([[acute exacerbations of COPD|acute exacerbations]]) or disease progression. Early findings indicate a possible role for eNO in predicting the response to inhaled glucocorticoids and the degree of airway obstruction reversibility.

Children with cystic fibrosis have been found to have low eNO levels. In subjects with [[bronchiectasis]] (a state of localized, irreversible dilatation of part of the [[bronchial tree]]) not due to cystic fibrosis, high levels have been found. [[Sarcoidosis]] could also feature increased eNO. Low levels have been found in [[primary ciliary dyskinesia]], [[bronchopulmonary dysplasia]], and [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]]. In the latter condition, ''inhaled'' NO is used as a diagnostic test of the response of the [[pulmonary arteries]] to [[vasodilators]] (agents that relax the blood vessels).

eNO has also been associated with wheeze, rhinitis and nasal allergy in primary school children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Prins S, Marcucci F, Sensi L, Van de Mieroop E, Nelen V, Nawrot TS, Schoeters G, Koppen G | display-authors = 6 | title = Exhaled nitric oxide and nasal tryptase are associated with wheeze, rhinitis and nasal allergy in primary school children | journal = Biomarkers | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 481–7 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25019424 | doi = 10.3109/1354750x.2014.937362 | s2cid = 207522881 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement techniques==
[[Image:Exhaled NO experiment.jpg|thumb|An experimental setup used to measure the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath samples. The subject blows into the tube (1) after a mouthpiece (2) has been connected to it. The wires on the side are part of the system that measures parameters like breath velocity, while the exhaled gas is taken to a FeNO analyzer (3).]]
The most widely used technique to measure eNO is with a [[chemical reaction]] that produces [[light]]; this is called a [[chemiluminescence]] reaction. The NO in the breath sample reacts with [[ozone]] to form [[nitrogen dioxide]] in an [[excited state]]. When this returns to its ground state, it emits light in quantities that are [[stoichiometry|proportional]] to the amount of exhaled NO.
[[File:Evernoa FENO device.jpg|thumb|evernoa medical device for measurement of exhaled nitric oxide]]
The subject can exhale directly into a measurement device ('online' technique), or into a reservoir that can afterwards be connected to the analyser ('offline' technique).&lt;ref name="pmid15817806"&gt;{{cite journal | title = ATS/ERS recommendations for standardized procedures for the online and offline measurement of exhaled lower respiratory nitric oxide and nasal nitric oxide, 2005 | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = 8 | pages = 912–30 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 15817806 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200406-710ST | author1 = American Thoracic Society | author2 = European Respiratory Society | s2cid = 1883790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the former technique, the early and later NO in the breath sample can be analysed separately. The test requires little coordination from the subject, and children older than 4 can be tested successfully.&lt;ref name="pmid15940124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15965893"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Napier E, Turner SW | title = Methodological issues related to exhaled nitric oxide measurement in children aged four to six years | journal = Pediatric Pulmonology | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 97–104 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 15965893 | doi = 10.1002/ppul.20249 | s2cid = 24859293 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK have published guidance on available measuring devices: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg12

==Reference range==
The upper normal level of eNO in different studies ranges from 20 to 30 [[parts per billion]]. However, several major features influence the reference values. Men have higher eNO values than women. Smoking notoriously lowers eNO values, and even former smoking status can influence results. The levels are higher in people with an [[atopic]] constitution (a tendency towards [[allergies]]).&lt;ref name="pmid17478616"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Travers J, Marsh S, Aldington S, Williams M, Shirtcliffe P, Pritchard A, Weatherall M, Beasley R | s2cid = 23531755 | display-authors = 6 | title = Reference ranges for exhaled nitric oxide derived from a random community survey of adults | journal = American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 176 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–42 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17478616 | doi = 10.1164/rccm.200609-1346OC }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of eNO is also flow-dependent (higher at lower flow rates and vice versa), so measurements are normally measured at 50 ml/s. Age or height could also considerably confound eNO values in children.&lt;ref name="pmid15940124"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buchvald F, Baraldi E, Carraro S, Gaston B, De Jongste J, Pijnenburg MW, Silkoff PE, Bisgaard H | display-authors = 6 | title = Measurements of exhaled nitric oxide in healthy subjects age 4 to 17 years | journal = The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 115 | issue = 6 | pages = 1130–6 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15940124 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2005.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of these effects lies in the order of 10%, so even single cut-off values might be useful.&lt;ref name="pmid18188021"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner S | title = Exhaled nitric oxide in the diagnosis and management of asthma | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 70–6 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18188021 | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0b013e3282f3b4b0 | s2cid = 20449485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Until the 1980s, nitric oxide, a product of [[fossil fuel]] combustion, was thought only to play a role the detrimental effects of [[air pollution]] on the [[respiratory tract]].&lt;ref name="pmid18188021"/&gt; In 1987, experiments with [[coronary arteries]] showed that nitric oxide was the long sought [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]]. After scientists realised that NO played a biological role, its role as a [[cell signalling]] molecule and [[neurotransmitter]] became clear from abundant studies.&lt;ref name="pmid17504190"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turner S | title = The role of exhaled nitric oxide in the diagnosis, management and treatment of asthma | journal = Mini Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 539–42 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17504190 | doi = 10.2174/138955707780619635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NO was first detected in exhaled breath samples in 1991.&lt;ref name="pmid1721811"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gustafsson LE, Leone AM, Persson MG, Wiklund NP, Moncada S | title = Endogenous nitric oxide is present in the exhaled air of rabbits, guinea pigs and humans | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 852–7 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1721811 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(91)91268-H }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, NO was voted molecule of the year by the scientific journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid1470903"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koshland DE | title = The molecule of the year | journal = Science | volume = 258 | issue = 5090 | pages = 1861 | date = December 1992 | pmid = 1470903 | doi = 10.1126/science.1470903 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, researchers from the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Sweden were the first to report increased eNO in asthmatics.&lt;ref name="pmid7507065"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alving K, Weitzberg E, Lundberg JM | title = Increased amount of nitric oxide in exhaled air of asthmatics | journal = The European Respiratory Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 1368–70 | date = October 1993 | doi = 10.1183/09031936.93.06091368 | pmid = 7507065 | s2cid = 5947308 | doi-access = free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, NO is not only used in breath tests but also as a therapeutic agent for conditions such as [[pulmonary arterial hypertension]] and possibly for the [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]].

      <text bytes="16182" xml:space="preserve">{{short description|Response to the consumption of alcohol}}
'''Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions''', also termed '''alcohol-induced asthma''' and '''alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms''', are increasingly recognized as a pathological [[bronchoconstriction]] response to the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] that afflicts many people with a "classical" form of '''[[asthma]]''', the airway constriction disease evoked by the inhalation of allergens.  Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions reflect the operation of different and often racially related mechanisms that differ from those of classical, allergen-induced asthma.

== History ==
In 1973, Breslin et al. tested the effects of alcoholic beverage consumption on the respiratory symptoms of 11 asthmatic subjects who gave a history of asthma attacks following certain alcoholic beverages.  In response to ingesting the type of beverage that the subjects reported to provoke their symptoms, six developed the asthmatic symptom of chest tightness, two developed a symptom often associated with asthma, [[rhinitis]], and one subject developed both chest tightness and rhinitis.  Symptoms developed almost immediately after ingestion. Inhalation of fumes from the beverages did not precipitate symptoms. And bronchoconstriction in response to the ingestion was confirmed in the three patients evaluated by [[pulmonary function tests]].&lt;ref&gt;Clin Allergy. 1973 Mar;3(1):71-82&lt;/ref&gt;  The study suggested that these reactions were induced by non-alcoholic [[allergens]] that were contained in or contaminated the beverages.  

In 1978 a non-asthmatic female of Japanese descent with a history of moderately severe bronchoconstriction responses to various alcoholic beverages&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Am Rev Respir Dis. 1978 Jul;118(1):135-9&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1981 an asthmatic Japanese male with a similar history&lt;ref&gt;Chest. 1981 Aug;80(2):167-73&lt;/ref&gt; with beer or 95% pure [[ethanol]] were studied. They were found to develop bronchoconstriction after drinking apple juice containing alcohol. Intravenous infusion or inhalation of ethanol also caused bronchospasm responses in the male subject.  These studies suggested that alcohol itself caused the asthmatic symptoms triggered by alcoholic beverages.  

A subsequent study in 1986 found that 9 of 18 patients with a history of red-wine-induced asthma symptoms showed bronchoconstriction in response to ingesting red wine; the response correlated positively with the amount of [[sulfur dioxide]] contained in the provocative wine.&lt;ref&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1986 Dec;78(6):1126-&lt;/ref&gt;  The study suggested that the reaction was not allergen-induced but rather triggered by sulfur dioxide, a sulfur-dioxide-related agent, or an agent whose levels in alcohol beverages correlated positively with those of sulfur dioxide.  

Finally, a questionnaire survey of 366 asthmatic patients conducted in 2000 found that 33% reported asthma symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages; there was a significant association between wine-induced asthma and asthma triggered by sulfite-containing foods, by [[aspirin]], and by [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAID) other than aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2000 Mar;105(3):462-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The study suggested the [[salicylate]]-"contaminates" in wine may contribute to these responses.  

In other studies, D.P. Agarwal and colleagues associated race-based variations in the activity of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes with the occurrence of [[alcohol flush reaction]]s to alcohol and [[alcoholic beverages]] in certain Asian populations.&lt;ref&gt;Hum Genet. 1979 Oct 2;51(3):331-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Am J Hum Genet. 1983 Jul;35(4):769-72&lt;/ref&gt;  This early work is the basis for further studies that have defined not only many alcohol-induced flush reactions but also many alcohol-induced respiratory reactions as due to racially associated genetic differences in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes.

== In Asians ==
Alcohol-induced asthma reactions among Asians has been most thoroughly studied in those of native Japanese descent.  In such individuals, the ingestion of virtually any [[alcoholic beverage]] or pure [[ethanol]] and, in some cases, the smelling of ethanol fumes may be followed, typically within 1–30 minutes, by one or more of the following symptoms: an [[alcohol flush reaction]] (i.e. the "Asian flush syndrome"{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}), rapid heart rate, dizziness, light-headedness, [[urticaria]], systemic [[dermatitis]], [[rhinitis]], and, in about half of individuals with a history of asthma, exacerbation of asthmatic [[bronchoconstriction]] and related symptoms.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2013 Dec;111(6):439-45. {{doi| 10.1016/j.anai.2013.09.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In extremely rare instances, asthmatic symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages may occur in the absence of a history of asthma,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and cardiovascular collapse, [[anaphylaxis]], and even death may occur.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  These reactions appear due to a deficiency in the metabolism of the [[ethanol]] in the alcoholic beverage.

Humans metabolize [[ethanol]] to [[acetaldehyde]] primarily through NAD{{sup|+}}-dependent [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. [[ADH1A]], [[ADH1B]], and [[ADH1C]]), and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD{{smallsup|2}}-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 ([[ALDH2]]) to acetic acid.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2006;42(1):8-16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proc Nutr Soc. 2004 Feb;63(1):49-63&lt;/ref&gt;  East Asians have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching half) of their populations.  The deficiency has been most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese who have a variant ALDH2 allele termed '''glu487lys''', '''ALDH2*2''' or '''ALDH2*504lys''', which is a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] allele encoding in its amino acid residue 487 ([[glutamic acid]]) rather than [[lysine]]. In the Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are [[homozygous]] for the normal allele (sometimes termed '''ALDH2*1'''), 40% are [[heterozygous]] for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys.&lt;ref&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1998 May; 101(5):576-80&lt;/ref&gt;  Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a [[tetramer]] and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive, the glu487lys protein behaves as a [[dominant negative]] in inactivating the normal ALDH2 protein. Individuals homozygous for glu487lys have undetectable ALDH2 activity, while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity.&lt;ref&gt;Pharmacol Rev. 2012 Jul;64(3):520-39. {{doi| 10.1124/pr.111.005538}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In consequence, Japanese homozygous or, to a lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally, but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are thereby susceptible to a set of adverse responses to ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages. These responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]] [[urticaria]], systemic [[dermatitis]], and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions (i.e. [[rhinitis]] and, primarily in patients with a history of [[asthma]], mild to moderately [[bronchoconstriction]] exacerbations of their asthmatic disease.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  These allergic-reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30–60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical [[IgE]]- or [[T cell]]-related [[allergen]]-induced reactions, but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in stimulating tissue [[mast cells]] and blood-borne [[basophils]] to release [[histamine]], the probable evoker of these symptoms.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Feb 1;18(3):580-93. {{doi| 10.1093/hmg/ddn372}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; 
  
The percentages of glu487lys heterozygous plus homozygous [[genotypes]] follow: ~35% in native [[Caboclo]] of Brazil, 30% in Chinese, 28% in Koreans, 11% in [[Thai people]], 7% in Malaysians, 3% in natives of India, 3% in Hungarians, and 1% in Filipinos. The percentages are essentially 0% in individuals of Native African descent, Caucasians of Western European descent, Turks, Australian Aborigines, Australians of Western European descent, Swedish Lapps, and Alaskan Eskimos.&lt;ref&gt;Hum Genet. 1992 Jan;88(3):344-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  While the prevalence of flushing reactions is high in those non-Japanese populations that have a high prevalence of the glu487lys genotype, the percentages of these non-Japanese individuals with the glu487lys allele who experience respiratory symptoms, particularly asthmatic exacerbations, has yet to be defined.  

Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms result from a wide range of interacting genetic, metabolic, environmental, and social factors&lt;ref&gt;Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2006;42(1):8-16. Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neurosci Biobehav Rev. 2007;31(2):221-9. Epub 2006 Sep 5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  These interacting factors are likely to vary from one nationality group to another and thereby alter, perhaps dramatically, the [[phenotype]] produced by the glu487lys allele: the alcohol-induce reactions of Japanese with the glu487lys allele may not be good predictors of those occurring in other nationality groups. "Social factors", despite claims made by social constructionists, have no impact on a genetic aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

==In non-Asians==
The prevalence of ethanol-induced allergic symptoms in non-Asian genotypes commonly ranges above 5%, even though many of these non-Asian populations have no or very low levels of individuals bearing the glu487lys allele.  These "ethanol reactors" may have other gene-based abnormalities that cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde following the ingestion of ethanol or ethanol-containing beverages.  For example, the surveyed incidence of self-reported ethanol-induced flushing reactions in Scandinavians living in Copenhagen as well as Australians of European descent is about ~16% in individuals homozygous for the "normal" ADH1B gene, but runs to ~23% in individuals with the ADH1-Arg48His [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism]] variant. [[In vitro]], this variant metabolizes ethanol rapidly and, it is proposed but not proven, in humans may form acetaldehyde at levels exceeding ALDH2's acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2010;153(1):86-94. {{doi| 10.1159/000301583}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Presumably then, acetaldehyde provokes the respiratory symptoms in a manner similar to that occurring in Asians with the glu487lys ALDH2 variant.

In studies conducted in the USA and presumably therefore mainly on non-Asians, alcohol-induced rhinitis and exacerbations of asthma reactions are highly associated with [[aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease]] reactions; more than half of individuals suffering from the aspirin-induced sensitivity reaction will also suffer alcohol-induced reactions.&lt;ref&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract. 2014 Mar-Apr;2(2):208-13.. {{doi| 10.1016/j.jaip.2013.12.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It seems likely, although further study is needed, that most respiratory symptoms induced by alcoholic beverages, particular wines and beers, occurring in non-Asian individuals are due to true allergic  responses to the allergens that are part of, or contaminate, these drinks.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms can be strongly suggested on the basis of survey questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Clin Exp Allergy. 2008 Jan;38(1):145-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Questionnaires can be devised to determine the specific types of alcoholic beverages eliciting reactions. Reactions evoked by one or only a few but not other types of alcoholic beverage, particularly when the offending beverage(s) is wine and/or beer, suggest that the reactions are due to classical allergic reaction to allergens in the beverage; reactions to all or most types of alcoholic beverages favors a genetic (i.e. acetaldehyde-induced) basis.  Further differentiation between these two causes can be tested under medical supervision by determining if ingestion of a  water-diluted pure ethanol solution elicits reactions or if an offending alcoholic beverage but not the same beverage without ethanol elicits reactions. Either result would favor an acetaldehyde-induced genetic basis for the reaction.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;     
   
Diagnosis of alcohol sensitivity due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in individuals bearing the glu487lys ALDH2 allele can be made by measuring the diameter of the [[erythema]] (i.e. red) area developing under a 15 millimeter skin patch plaster soaked in 70% ethanol and applied for 48 hours (ethanol patch test). Erythema of 15 millimeters is considered positive, with a false positive ratio ([100 x {number of individuals with a positive patch test}]/{number of individuals with a normal ALDH2 genotype}) of 5.9% and a false negative ratio ([100 x {number of individuals with a negative patch test}]/{number of individuals with a glu487lys ALDH2 allele}) of 0%.&lt;ref&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 2001 Nov;108(5):715-9&lt;/ref&gt;  To resolve ambiguities in or replace the ethanol patch test for other reasons, a [[polymerase chain reaction]] using special primers and conditions can be used to directly detect the glu487lys ALDH2 genes.&lt;ref&gt;J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1998 May;101(5):576-80&lt;/ref&gt;  For other causes of acetaldehyde-induced alcohol sensitivities, the ethanol patch test will need to be tested for verification of its acetaldehyde basis and appropriate polymerase chain reactions will likewise be needed to  verify a genetic basis for symptoms.

Diagnosis of alcohol sensitivity due to allergic reactivity to the allergens in alcoholic beverages can be confirmed by standard skin prick tests, skin patch tests, blood tests, challenge tests, and challenge/elimination tests as conducted for determining the allergen causing other classical allergic reactions (see [[allergy]] and [[Skin allergy test]]s.)

== Treatment ==
Avoidance of ethanol is the safest, surest, and cheapest treatment.  Indeed, surveys find a positive correlation between high incidence of glu487lys ALDH2 allele-related alcohol-induced respiratory reactions as well as other causes of these reactions and low levels of alcohol consumption, alcoholism, and alcohol-related diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Pathol Biol (Paris). 2001 Nov;49(9):703-9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;  Evidently, people suffering these reactions self-impose avoidance behavior. Ethanol, at moderate to high concentrations, is used as a solvent to dissolve many types of medicines and other ingredients.  This pertains particularly to liquid cold medicines and mouthwashes.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  Ethanol avoidance includes avoiding ingesting and (depending on an individual's history) mouth-washing with such agents.

Type [[H1 antagonist]]s in the [[histamine antagonist]] family of drugs were tested in Japanese volunteers with alcohol-induced asthma (who presumably have glu487lys ALDH2 allele-associated asthma) and found to be completely effective in blocking bronchoconstriction responses to alcoholic beverages. These blockers, it is suggested, may be taken 1–2 hours before consumption of alcohol beverages as a preventative of alcohol-induced respiratory reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Eur Respir J. 1995 Apr;8(4):619-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1999 Apr;82(4):390-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In the absence of specific studies on the prevention of classical alcohol-induced rhinitis and asthma due to allergens in alcoholic beverages, see [[asthma]] section on Prevention and [[rhinitis]] section on Prevention of allergen-induced reactions.

In the absence of specific studies on the treatment of acute alcohol-induced bronchoconstriction and rhinitis, treatment guidelines should probably follow those of their comparable allergen-induced classical allergic reactions (see [[asthma]] section on Treatment and [[rhinitis]] section on Treatment), but possibly favoring the testing of H1 antagonist anti-histamines as part of the initial protocol.

The '''peak expiratory flow''' ('''PEF'''), also called '''peak expiratory flow rate''' ('''PEFR''') and '''peak flow measurement''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=2019-08-14 |title=Peak Flow Measurement |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/peak-flow-measurement |access-date=2023-06-22 |website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a person's maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a '''peak flow meter''', a small, hand-held device used to monitor a person's ability to breathe out air. It measures the airflow through the [[bronchus|bronchi]] and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. Peak expiratory flow is typically measured in units of liters per minute (L/min).

==Function==
[[File:Peak flow meter.jpg|thumb|Peak flow meter (made in USA)]]
Peak flow readings are higher when patients are well, and lower when the airways are constricted. From changes in recorded values, patients and doctors may determine lung functionality, the severity of asthma symptoms, and treatment.

Measurement of PEFR requires training to correctly use a meter and the normal expected value depends on the patient's sex, age, and height. It is classically reduced in obstructive lung disorders such as [[asthma]].

Due to the wide range of 'normal' values and the high degree of variability, peak flow is not the recommended test to identify asthma. However, it can be useful in some circumstances.

A small portion of people with [[asthma]] may benefit from regular peak flow monitoring. When monitoring is recommended, it is usually done in addition to reviewing asthma symptoms and frequency of reliever medication use.&lt;ref&gt;National Asthma Council of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

When peak flow is being monitored regularly, the results may be recorded on a peak flow chart. 

It is important to use the same peak flow meter every time.

== Scales or reference values ==

[[File:Normal values for peak expiratory flow - EU scale.png|thumb|300px|Normal values, shown on EU scale.&lt;ref&gt;Nunn, A. J., and I. Gregg. 1989. New regression equations for predicting peak expiratory flow in adults. Br. Med. J. 298: 1068-1070. Adapted by Clement Clarke for use in EU scale - see [http://www.peakflow.com/top_nav/normal_values/index.html Peakflow.com &gt; Predictive Normal Values (Nomogram, EU scale)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

To interpret the significance of peak expiratory flow measurements, a comparison is made to reference (normal, predicted) values based on measurements taken from the general population. Various reference values have been published in the literature and vary by population, ethnic group, age, sex, height and weight of the patient. For this reason, tables or charts are used to determine the normal value for a particular individual. More recently, [[medical calculators]] have been developed to calculate predicted values for peak expiratory flow. There are a number of non-equivalent scales used in the interpretation of peak expiratory flow.&lt;!--

Where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the value in the Wright scale.

These formulas have also been trended over time in both rural and metropolitan areas both as air quality studies and as studies on asthma due to the Peak Flow measurement's accuracy as a predictor of mortality and poor prognosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knudson|first1=RJ|title=Changes in the normal maximal expiratory flow-volume curve with growth and aging.|journal=Am Rev Respir Dis|date=1983|volume=127|issue=6|pages=725–34|pmid=6859656|doi=10.1164/arrd.1983.127.6.725|doi-broken-date=1 August 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
Measurements may be based on 1 second or less but are usually reported as a volume per minute. Electronic devices will sample the flow and multiply the sample volume(Litres) by 60, divided by the sample time(seconds) for a result measured in L/minute : &lt;math&gt; \frac{\text{sample volume} \times 60}{\text{sample time}}&lt;/math&gt;

The highest of three readings is used as the recorded value of the Peak Expiratory Flow Rate. It may be plotted out on [[graph paper]] charts together with a record of symptoms or using peak flow charting software. This allows patients to self-monitor and pass information back to their doctor or nurse.&lt;!--

==History==
The measurement of peak expiratory flow was pioneered by [[Martin Wright (bioengineer)|Martin Wright]], who produced the first meter specifically designed to measure this index of lung function. Since the original design of instrument was introduced in the late 1950s, and the subsequent development of a more portable, lower cost version (the "Mini-Wright" peak flow meter), other designs and copies have become available across the world.&lt;ref name="pmid13846051"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=WRIGHT BM, McKERROW CB |title=Maximum forced expiratory flow rate as a measure of ventilatory capacity: with a description of a new portable instrument for measuring it |journal=Br Med J |volume=2 |issue=5159 |pages=1041–6 |date=November 1959 |pmid=13846051 |pmc=1990874 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.5159.1041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemicals used for pool water disinfection can react with organic compounds in the water to create [[disinfection by-products]] or DBPs.

'''Thunderstorm asthma''' (also referred to in the media as '''thunder fever''' or a '''pollen bomb'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A change in the pollen season – but is it worse than normal? |url=https://blog.metoffice.gov.uk/2022/06/10/a-change-in-the-pollen-season-but-is-it-worse-than-normal/ |website=UK Met Office |access-date=20 July 2022 |language=en |date=10 June 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the triggering of an [[asthma]] attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local [[thunderstorm]]. Due to the acute nature of the onset and wide exposure of local populations to the same triggering conditions, severe epidemic thunderstorm asthma events can put significant and unmanageable stress on public health facilities.

Widely recognised but not fully understood, it has been proposed that during a thunderstorm, [[pollen]] grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Sample |first=Ian |date=November 25, 2016 |title=Thunderstorm asthma: how seasonal weather can affect human health |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/24/melbourne-suffers-most-lethal-episode-of-thunderstorm-asthma |access-date=December 11, 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=thunderstorm+asthma|title=thunderstorm asthma - PubMed - NCBI|last=pubmeddev|website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.&lt;ref&gt;Suphioglu C.

==History==
The phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma has been recognised since the 1980s, with an event in [[Birmingham]], England, in July 1983 often considered the first prominent example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Packe|first1=G. E.|last2=Ayres|first2=JonG.|title=Asthma Outbreak During a Thunderstorm|date=1985-07-27|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673685915107|journal=The Lancet|series=Originally published as Volume 2, Issue 8448|language=en|volume=326|issue=8448|pages=199–204|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(85)91510-7|pmid=2862383|s2cid=22213257|issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study which reviewed instances of abnormally high asthma-related admissions to emergency departments between 1983 and 2013 identified strong correlation between those instances and thunderstorms, while noting that such events were so rare that very little detailed research into the phenomenon had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Dabrera|first1=G.|last2=Murray|first2=V.|last3=Emberlin|first3=J.|last4=Ayres|first4=J.

A significant impetus in the study of the phenomenon occurred after an event in November 2016 in [[Melbourne]], Australia. Recognised as the most severe epidemic thunderstorm asthma event on record, the onset overwhelmed the city's ambulance system and some local hospitals, saw a ten-fold increase in asthma cases presenting to emergency departments compared with average, and resulted in ten deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Thien|first1=F.|last2=Beggs|first2=P.

==Statistics==
Many of those affected during a thunderstorm asthma outbreak may have never experienced an asthma attack before.&lt;ref name="freakweather"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/23/health/thunderstorm-asthma-australia/index.html |title='Thunder asthma:' Deadly illness caused by freak weather|author1=Reed Alexander |author2=James Griffiths |date=November 23, 2016|access-date=November 23, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been found 95% of those that were affected by thunderstorm asthma had a history of [[hayfever]], and 96% of those people had tested positive to grass pollen allergies, particularly rye grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-22/what-is-thunderstorm-asthma/8044920 |title=What is thunderstorm asthma? - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |newspaper=ABC News |date= 21 November 2016|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rye grass pollen grain can hold up to 700 tiny starch granules, measuring 0.6 to 2.5 μm, small enough to reach the lower airways in the lung.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Dockrill |url=http://www.sciencealert.com/thunderstorm-asthma-is-a-real-thing-that-s-killed-2-people-in-australia |title=Thunderstorm asthma is a real thing that's killed 2 people in Australia |website=ScienceAlert.com |date=2015-08-21 |access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D'Amato G, Annesi Maesano I, Molino A, Vitale C, D'Amato M.

== Prevention ==
Patients with a history of grass allergies should be tested for asthma and treated for the grass allergies and asthma if also present. Patients with known asthma should be treated and counseled on the importance of adherence to preventative medication protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Harun|first1=Nur-Shirin|last2=Lachapelle|first2=Philippe|last3=Douglass|first3=Jo|date=2019|title=Thunderstorm-triggered asthma: what we know so far|journal=Journal of Asthma and Allergy|volume=12|pages=101–108|doi=10.2147/JAA.S175155|issn=1178-6965|pmc=6512777|pmid=31190900 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preventative treatment found useful for severe asthma includes [[Allergen immunotherapy]] (AIT) particularly sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lombardi|first1=Carlo|last2=Savi|first2=Eleonora|last3=Ridolo|first3=Erminia|last4=Passalacqua|first4=Giovanni|last5=Canonica|first5=Giorgio Walter|date=2017|title=Is allergic sensitization relevant in severe asthma?

==Pathophysiology==

A child's allergy is an immune system reaction to a foreign substance, or allergen, that is considered harmless to most. According to Dr. James Fernandez with the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University, "Genetic and environmental factors work together to contribute to the development of allergies."&lt;ref name = merck&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fernandez |first1=James |title=Overview of Allergic Reactions |url=https://www.merckmanuals.com/home/immune-disorders/allergic-reactions-and-other-hypersensitivity-disorders/overview-of-allergic-reactions |website=Merck Manuals |publisher=Merck |access-date=30 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon contact with an allergen, a child’s immune system produces antibodies which patrol the body for future encounters with the invader.&lt;ref name = mcallergies&gt;{{cite web |title=Allergies |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/allergies/symptoms-causes/syc-20351497 |website=Mayo Clinic |access-date=19 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; During any future encounters, the antibodies release immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes, skin, or stomach lining.&lt;ref name = "mcallergies"/&gt;&lt;ref name = FDA1&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/consumerupdates/ucm273617.htm | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration | date = 1 June 2017|access-date = 25 July 2017 | title = Allergy Relief for Your Child }}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development and symptoms of [[asthma]] can also be triggered by allergies; indoor allergens and indoor volatile organic compounds, such as formaldehyde, have been known to do so.&lt;ref name = "FDA1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21301330"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ahluwalia|first=SK|author2=Matsui, EC|title=The indoor environment and its effects on childhood asthma|journal=Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology|date=April 2011|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–43|pmid=21301330|doi=10.1097/ACI.0b013e3283445921|s2cid=35075329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rao|first=D|author2=Phipatanakul, W|title=Impact of environmental controls on childhood asthma|journal=Current Allergy and Asthma Reports|date=October 2011|volume=11|issue=5|pages=414–20|pmid=21710109|doi=10.1007/s11882-011-0206-7|pmc=3166452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20064771"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGwin|first=G|author2=Lienert, J |author3=Kennedy, JI|title=Formaldehyde exposure and asthma in children: a systematic review|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|date=March 2010|volume=118|issue=3|pages=313–7|pmid=20064771|doi=10.1289/ehp.0901143|pmc=2854756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Durmowicz, M.D., a pediatric pulmonary doctor at the FDA also says that, if a child has both allergies and asthma, "not controlling the allergies can make asthma worse."&lt;ref name = "FDA1"/&gt;

==Signs/Symptoms==

According to the Mayo Clinic, “Allergy symptoms, which depend on the substance involved, can affect your airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system.”&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt; The severity of the following symptoms varies from child to child.&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;

The symptoms of indoor and outdoor allergies in children may include:&lt;ref name = claritinIn&gt;{{cite web |title=Children's Indoor Allergies |url=https://www.claritin.com/childrens-indoor-allergies |website=Claritin |access-date=30 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = claritinOut&gt;{{cite web |title=Children's Outdoor Seasonal Allergies |url=https://www.claritin.com/childrens-outdoor-seasonal-allergies |website=Claritin |access-date=30 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Sneezing
* Itchy nose or throat
* Nasal congestion

Symptoms of indoor allergies can occur year-round but tend to be more troublesome during the winter months when children are inside more often.&lt;ref name = "claritinIn"/&gt; However, outdoor allergies, or seasonal allergies, normally change with the season.&lt;ref name = "claritinOut"/&gt;

The potential symptoms of a food allergy include:&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;
* Tingling/itching in the mouth
* Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, throat, or other body parts
* Hives, itching, or eczema
* Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting
* [[Anaphylaxis]] (life-threatening)

Possible symptoms of a drug allergy include:&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;
* Hives
* Itchy skin
* Rash
* Facial swelling
* Wheezing
* Anaphylaxis

Symptoms of a potential insect bite/sting allergy include:&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;
* A large area of swelling (edema) at the bite/sting site
* Itching or hives all over the body
* Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath
* Anaphylaxis

Symptoms of allergic skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, or eczema, include:&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;
* Itching
* Redness
* Flaking

==Diagnosis==

There are some different ways that can lead allergists to an official diagnosis of an allergy. These methods include:&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;
* Family history of allergies
* A diary with potential triggers or foods the child eats and reactions to them
* Elimination diet
* Skin tests (skin prick test and intradermal test)
* Blood test (allergen-specific serum IgE test)
* Provocative testing (oral food challenge, etc.)

Family medical history can be used to help determine if a child may have an allergy because of genetics. "Genes are thought to be involved because specific mutations are common among people with allergies and because allergies tend to run in families."&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; However, it is not the specific allergies that are passed down, just the likelihood of developing allergies.&lt;ref name="jh" /&gt;

Keeping a diary of the child’s symptoms and possible triggers can help an allergist determine if the child has an allergy or guide decisions for further testing. The possible allergens tracked in this manner include food, skin, indoor and outdoor allergens. Keeping track of when the symptoms appear/the reaction occurs can also help determine the possible triggers, as "[f]ood allergy symptoms usually develop within minutes to 2 hours after eating the offending food."&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;

An elimination diet involves complete avoidance of suspected food allergens for 1–2 weeks and readding them to the child’s diet one at a time to watch for symptoms.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; This method, however, may not always be accurate in identifying food allergies because it also works for determining food sensitivities/intolerances, which are different.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;

[[File:Skin Prick Test.png|thumb|Skin Prick Test]]
There are two types of skin tests that are commonly used for diagnosing allergies. The first one done is the skin prick test, which can identify most allergens.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; This test involves pricking a needle through a drop of each control and allergen test solutions into the child’s skin.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; The intradermal test may be done second if no allergen is identified with the skin prick test.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; This test is more sensitive and involves injecting tiny amounts of the control and allergen test solutions into the child’s skin with a needle.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; For either test, any allergies will result with a wheal and flare reaction (swelled center and surrounding circular red area) at the pinprick site.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; For accurate results, any child undergoing either test will need to stop taking any drugs/medications that may suppress a reaction.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;

For children who cannot receive either skin test, the blood test is used to determine "whether IgE in the person's blood binds to the specific allergen used for the test."&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; IgE is immunoglobulin E – the antibody produced by the immune system to protect the body from the "invader."&lt;ref name="jh" /&gt; A specific allergy can be confirmed if binding occurs with that allergen.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;
Provocative testing for any type of allergen involves directly exposing the child to small but increasing amounts of a suspected allergen.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; It is done at a doctor’s office by a doctor who can confirm the allergy if a reaction occurs during the test.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;

==Prevention, Management, &amp; Treatments==

[[File:Metered-Dose Inhaler (Child).png|thumb|Some older children can be taught to use their prescribed Metered-Dose Inhaler.]]
[[File:Metered-Dose Inhaler Mask (Child).png|thumb|Metered-Dose Inhaler Mask (Child)]]

There is no cure for allergies, making the avoidance of allergens one of the most important ways to prevent a reaction.&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt; Keeping a diary of symptoms, potential triggers, activities, and what helps reduce symptoms is also a helpful form of prevention and management.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;

For pet allergies, it may help to keep pet-free zones in the house (bedrooms), give furry friends frequent baths, have kids wash hands after petting and avoid touching their eyes, and use over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine to reduce symptoms.&lt;ref name="claritinIn" /&gt; These OTC allergy medications include antihistamines, such as Benadryl, Claritin, and Allegra, and nasal corticosteroids, such as Flonase and Afrin.&lt;ref name=aap.org&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/news-features-and-safety-tips/Pages/Allergy-Tips.aspx|title=Allergy Tips|website=www.aap.org|access-date=25 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The following tips are from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Feel free to excerpt the tips or use them in their entirety for any print or broadcast story, with acknowledgment of source: Allergies and Asthma: What Every Parent Needs to Know, by the American Academy of Pediatrics.--&gt; However, it is important to consult a doctor before taking any new medications. OTC medications may not work for every child, but a doctor may be able to prescribe a different, stronger medication or alternative treatment.&lt;ref name="FDA1" /&gt; Immunotherapy in the form of allergy shots is one alternative treatment.&lt;ref name="FDA1" /&gt; If the child’s reactions cannot be maintained using these methods, it may be better to find a new home for the pet and get a different one.

For other indoor allergies, thoroughly clean the house, bedding, and stuffed animals frequently.&lt;ref name="claritinIn" /&gt; Using special hypoallergenic furniture and covers for bedding, trading carpet for hardwood flooring, dehumidifying, and letting in sunlight may also help with some allergens.&lt;ref name="claritinIn" /&gt; If present, cockroaches, mice, and rats should be controlled to reduce symptoms as well.

Outdoor allergy symptoms can be managed by strategically planning outdoor play time, removing shoes and clothes and bathing after playing outside, keeping car and house windows closed and using the air conditioning, planting an allergy-friendly yard for kids, and keeping allergy medicine handy.&lt;ref name="FDA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="claritinOut" /&gt; It may also help to keep leaves and grass clippings away from the house, keep trees and bushes trimmed, and avoid drying clothes on outdoor clotheslines.&lt;ref name="FDA1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="claritinOut" /&gt; Allergy shots are another possible means of management/treatment for these allergies as well, if necessary.&lt;ref name="FDA1" /&gt;

Reactions to food allergens can also be prevented in multiple ways. One of these ways is avoiding cross contamination of allergens into safe foods.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; Keeping hands/gloves, utensils, surfaces, etc. clean is important. Another effective way to avoid these allergens is to read food labels on everything that has one that may be ingested.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; If a product contains or may contain one of the major nine allergens, the food labels are required to have a special note to inform potential consumers.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; Other preventative measures include informing the child, relatives, babysitters, teachers, and any other care givers of the child’s allergy and ways to avoid/treat it and avoiding any foods that you are unsure of that were made by others.&lt;ref name="jh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; This could be food at school, a restaurant, or any social gathering.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt;

For bug bite/sting and skin allergens, using fragrance-free skincare products, keeping the skin moisturized, using insect repellent, and wearing protective clothing are some of the easiest ways to prevent a reaction.&lt;ref name="allegra" /&gt; OTC medications, prescription (steroid) medications and creams, allergy shots, and biologics are also effective ways to manage/treat some skin allergies.&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;&lt;ref name = biologics&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keyser |first1=Heather |last2=Chipps |first2=Bradley |last3=Dinakar |first3=Chitra |title=Biologics for Asthma and Allergic Skin Diseases in Children |journal=Pediatrics |date=1 November 2021 |volume=148 |issue=5 |doi=10.1542/peds.2021-054270 |pmid=34663682 |s2cid=239026000 |url=https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-054270 |access-date=30 April 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also best to avoid scratching any affected area(s) as much as possible.&lt;ref name="allegra" /&gt;

As they get older, some children may outgrow their allergies.&lt;ref name="mcfa" /&gt; Others can also be desensitized to an allergen through exposure to the allergen, but this is a process that takes time and is not always necessary or possible.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;

==Severe Allergies &amp; Reactions==

If a child has any severe allergies that may be life-threatening, the Mayo Clinic recommends having the child wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that would inform others of the allergy if the child was ever unable to communicate.&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt; It is also crucial to always have an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen, etc.) on hand that is not expired.&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt; Antihistamine medications are also helpful.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt;

If the child encounters the allergen and shows signs of anaphylaxis, use the epinephrine auto-injector first, if available, and seek medical help immediately. Antihistamine medication can also help slow the reaction in addition to epinephrine if it has been approved for combination by your doctor.&lt;ref name="merck" /&gt; Otherwise, call 911 or your other local emergency number immediately for emergency medical help.&lt;ref name="mcallergies" /&gt;

'''{{nihongo|Yokkaichi asthma|四日市ぜんそく|Yokkaichi zensoku}}''' refers to cases of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[pulmonary emphysema]], and [[bronchial asthma]] in humans and various environmental changes usually attributed to [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions which appeared as smog over the city of [[Yokkaichi]] in [[Mie Prefecture]], [[Japan]] between 1960 and 1972, though other [[SOx|SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] compounds have been proposed. The generally accepted source of the sulfur oxide pollution was the Yokkaichi Kombinato petrochemical processing facilities and refineries built in Yokkaichi between 1959 and 1972 which did not properly desulfurize the high sulfur content in its crude oil. Yokkaichi asthma is considered one of the [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan]] and was the subject of Japan's first court case related to pollution.&lt;ref name="bookrags"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/yokkaichi-asthma-enve-02/ | title=Yokkaichi Asthma|publisher=Environmental Encyclopedia |access-date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TransnationalJAPN"&gt;{{cite book|last= Avenell|first=Simon |date=2017|title=Transnational Japan in the Global Environmental Movement|publisher=University of Hawaii Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICETT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icett.or.jp/english/abatement/mie/index.html|title=Approaches to Air pollution Control (Case Study-1) Yokkaichi City, Mie prefecture |publisher=International Center for Environmental Technology Transfer|access-date=31 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry background==
In 1899, wealthy Yokkaichi landowner Inaba San'emon transformed Yokkaichi's wetlands into a port for textile exports. Ishihara Industries built an oil refinery in Yokkaichi's remaining marshes in 1937. In 1938, the imperial navy built another oil refinery in Yokkaichi that would later become a target for American air raid bombing during the [[Pacific War]]. The oil refineries and a majority of the city were destroyed in 1945.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt; In 1955, the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] began its policy to transition Japan's primary fossil fuel source from [[coal]] to [[petroleum]], and oil refineries were once again opened in Yokkaichi. The oil used in Yokkaichi was primarily imported from the [[Middle East]], which contained 2% [[sulfur]] in sulfur containing compounds, resulting in a white-colored [[smog]] developing over the city.&lt;ref name="United Nations Univ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/uu35ie/uu35ie08.htm|title=Japan's Post-Second World War environmental problems|publisher=United Nations University|access-date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Petrochemical Complex No.1===
To accomplish the goal of the government-issued Petrochem Industry Program - Phase I from 1955, the Daichi Petrochemical Complex, a joint project of Showa Oil and [[Shell Oil Company]], began construction in 1956 around the remnants of [[World War II]] naval fuel factories in south Yokkaichi Harbor which were destroyed by bombing before their operation began. The location was convenient because waste could easily be dumped into the ocean and Yokkaichi's port provided a means for easily shipping products.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EJA_Yokkaichi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/yokkaichi-asthma-japan|title=Yokkaichi asthma, Japan|publisher=[[Environmental Justice Atlas]]|access-date=29 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daichi Petrochemical Complex, the first of its kind in Japan, contained an [[oil refinery]], a [[petrochemical]] plant, ethylene plant, and a [[power station]] when it began operation in 1959.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; As demand increased, the operation expanded its workday so that production could continue twenty four hours a day.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt;

===Petrochemical Complex No.2===
In 1960, the government of Prime Minister [[Hayato Ikeda]] accelerated the growth of petrochemical production as part of its goal to double individual incomes of Japanese citizens over a 10-year period. The Petrochemical Industry Program - Phase II began as MITI announced that a second complex was to be constructed on [[reclaimed land]] in northern Yokkaichi. During its trial run, the complex broke down and expelled odorous runoff that spurred many complaints by citizens. The second complex went online officially in 1963.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt;

==Symptoms==
Beginning shortly after the opening of the first complex in 1959, severe cases of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[pulmonary emphysema]], and [[bronchial asthma]] rose quickly among the local inhabitants, particularly in the Isozu and Shiohama districts which were closest to the factories, and among males over 50.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AirPollution"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth1963/2/2/2_2_87/_article| title=Air Pollution in Yokkaichi Area with Special Regards to the Problem of 'Yokkaichi-Asthma'| year=1964| last1=Yoshida| first1=Katsumi| last2=Oshima| first2=Hidehiko| last3=Imai| first3=Masayuki|journal=Industrial Health| volume=2| issue=2| pages=87–94| doi=10.2486/indhealth.2.87| doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other chronic symptoms included sore throat.&lt;ref name="TransnationalJAPN" /&gt; Symptoms showed some relief when affected people left areas of high air pollution.

==Environmental effects==

===Marine life===
The fishing industry is considered the first victim of Yokkaichi pollution. Fish caught in [[Ise Bay]] as far as five miles from the mouth of [[Suzuka River]] developed a bad taste and greasy smell in 1959. Fish sent to [[Tsukiji|Tsukiji, Tokyo]] were returned to Ise due to complaints, causing local fishermen to petition the government for compensation for their unsaleable fish in 1960.&lt;ref name="bookrags" /&gt; Special Committee of Promotion Council for Ise Bay Industrial Waste Water Pollution Countermeasures was organized by the Mie Prefectural Government in response to the incident and attributed the foul smelling fish and oily water texture to mineral oil in waste water expelled into the bay by nearby petrochemical plants and oil refineries.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; In 1962 during a factory tour, factory officials interviewed by Research Committee on Pollution founding member Miyamato Ken'ichi maintained despite these findings that the foul smelling fish was due to a sunken ship in Ise bay.&lt;ref name="TransnationalJAPN" /&gt;

===Air quality===
Soot and white smog from the petrochemical plants filled the skies of Yokkaichi, and were the main concern of complaints before Petrochemical Complex No. 2 was constructed in 1963. The air was said to have an offensive odor.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; Researchers in the Journal of Environmental Health found in 1985 that as air quality decreased, mortality rate for bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis cases increased.&lt;ref name="Archives"&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Mortality from Asthma and Chronic Bronchitis Associated with Changes in Sulfur Oxides Air Pollution|doi=10.1080/00039896.1986.9935762| year=1986| last1=Masayuki| first1=Imai|last2=Yoshida |first2=Katsumi |last3=Kitabatake |first3=Masayoshi | journal=Archives of Environmental Health|volume=41|issue=1|pages=29–35|pmid=3963884 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soil quality===
A study in 1975 from Mie University in Japan found a significant correlation between the number of Yokkaichi asthma patients and decrease in expected grain yield for May to September summer crops.&lt;ref name="riceyield"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Characteristics in the growth and grain production of rice plant in air pollution area (Yokkaichi City), and the significance as the indicator plant for monitoring of air pollution | year=1975| last1=Taniyama| first1=T.| journal=International Congress of Scientists on the Human Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| [[Sulfur dioxide]], a toxic gas found in high concentrations in the air of Yokkaichi and initially believed to be the cause of the asthma cases.
|}
All clinical cases of Yokkaichi asthma began after the establishment of the oil refinery and petroleum chemical plants in 1959.&lt;ref name="AirPollution" /&gt;

Complaints from citizens of offensive odors spurred investigation. Initially, the suspected sources of the odors included SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S), methylmercaptan, aldehydes, and other substances found to be leaking from the factories.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; However, sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of high sulfur content oil has typically been attributed as the cause of the disease since the beginning.

Despite common belief that SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the main source of the asthma, by investigating sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide levels in Yokkaichi and analyzing compound toxicity levels, a study conducted in 1984 from Yokohama National University concluded that respiratory diseases were not a result of sulfur dioxide, but rather due to a titanium oxide manufacturing plant venting concentrated sulfuric acid mists downwind onto populated urban areas. The high concentration of Yokkaichi asthma patients in Isozu Village can be farther accounted for under this conclusion, as the source of sulfur trioxide emissions is 2 kilometers south of the most affected population.&lt;ref name="Cause Analysis" /&gt; A 2001 study by several researchers in the Environmental Management journal confirmed by analyzing the effects of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on humans that SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was likely the real cause of the asthma. They farther propose that one of the reasons [[flue-gas desulfurization]] implementation did not lead to the disappearance of all cases was due to differences in SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cleanup.&lt;ref name="EnviroManage"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Environmental Management of Sulfur Trioxide Emission: Impact of SO3 on Human Health| year=2001| last1=Kikuchi| first1=Ryunosuke|journal=Environmental Management| volume=27| issue=6| pages=837–844| doi=10.1007/s002670010192| pmid=11393318| s2cid=21009310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==
In 1960, those living in Isozu complained to Yokkaichi officials about noise from the factories and sickness caused by the chemicals, but they were ignored. Children were advised by teachers in Mihana Primary School to avoid breathing as much as possible. When the fishing industries in Yokkaichi began to collapse in spring 1960, the government finally issued a 100 million yen settlement that was to be divided up and distributed by Yokkaichi fishing unions. This settlement did nothing about the source of pollution.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt; In August 1960, The Yokkaichi City Environmental Pollution Control Measures Committee was organized by the city of Yokkaichi prompted by farther citizen complaints. The committee found that the Isozu district had six times the SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content in air of the rest of Yokkaichi and concluded that the asthma would likely cause an increase in mortality rate.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; They found that children were affected the most, and that about half of the children in Isozu district had the disease.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt;

When the pollution did not stop, angry fishermen from Isozu upset with the government's lack of action attempted to plug an industrial drainpipe belonging to Mie electric company with sandbags. To prevent the fishermen from doing so, the company increased emissions and a fight broke out between those working for the company and the fishermen that had to be defused by local officials. This incident led to investigations in Yokkaichi by the national government.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt;

The national government sent out investigators with the issue of the Special Survey Council on Yokkaichi Area Air Pollution in 1963, and they concluded their report in March 1964.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; Meanwhile, the government offered more compensation to fishermen following findings in 1965. Through the survey council's investigation Yokkaichi became an official target area of the 1968 Soot and Smoke Regulation Law. However, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; air pollution did not decrease, most notable through the suicide of confection shop owner Outani Kazuhiko, who wrote a note blaming the bad air for his death.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt; Through this law, taller smokestacks were built, but they simply spread the pollution over a wider area and did not help alleviate the health issues.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; In 1965, the local government offered more compensation to fishermen following Special Survey Council on Yokkaichi Area Air Pollution findings in what would become the world's first public-relief system for pollution victims.&lt;ref name="ToxicArch" /&gt; For the first year, this was financed by the local government, but was financed by the national government's treasury in its second year.&lt;ref name="Mortality"/&gt;

Isozu district Yokkaichi residents with asthma filed a civil suit against companies with ties to Showa Yokkaichi Oil's Petrochemical Complex No. 1 in 1967 which would go on to become Japan's first court trial related to pollution. The trial ended in 1972 in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the company had committed negligence.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt; After the trial, the local Yokkaichi government requested that the city be considered a target area for the 1968 Soot and Smoke Regulation Law. The 1968 Air Pollution Control Law led to the implementation of a [[flue-gas desulfurization]] processes for all emissions, which gradually led to health improvement in the local populace.&lt;ref name="ICETT" /&gt;

==Other cases==

Yokkaichi asthma has been identified in other rapidly industrializing areas in parts of the world, including [[Mexico City]], [[Singapore]], and cities in  mainland [[China]] like [[Guangzhou]] where air pollution caused by smog can lead to chronic asthma.&lt;ref name="terradaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terradaily.com/2004/040217072454.bopau66h.html|title=Asthma on the rise in Asia due to mounting urbanisation, pollution|publisher=TerraDaily.com|access-date=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1809705.stm|title=Mexico City's dirty truth|publisher=BBC|access-date=1 April 2010 | date=11 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfur oxides have also been attributed to causing other Japanese city asthma outbreaks, such as in the [[Nishiyodogawa-ku, Osaka|Nishiyodogawa]] industrial district of [[Osaka]], Japan.&lt;ref name="EJA_Osaka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/nishiyodogawa-osaka-air-pollution-and-other-damage|title=Nishiyodogawa in Osaka, air pollution court cases, Japan|publisher=[[Environmental Justice Atlas]]|access-date=31 March 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Occupational asthma''' is new onset [[asthma]] or the recurrence of previously quiescent asthma directly caused by exposure to an agent at workplace. It is an [[occupational lung disease]] and a type of work-related [[asthma]]. Agents that can induce occupational asthma can be grouped into sensitizers and irritants.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tarlo|first1=Susan M.|last2=Balmes|first2=John|last3=Balkissoon|first3=Ronald|last4=Beach|first4=Jeremy|last5=Beckett|first5=William|last6=Bernstein|first6=David|last7=Blanc|first7=Paul D.|last8=Brooks|first8=Stuart M.|last9=Cowl|first9=Clayton T.|date=September 2008|title=Diagnosis and management of work-related asthma: American College Of Chest Physicians Consensus Statement|journal=Chest|volume=134|issue=3 Suppl|pages=1S–41S|doi=10.1378/chest.08-0201|issn=0012-3692|pmid=18779187}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sensitizer-induced'' occupational asthma is an immunologic form of asthma which occurs due to inhalation of specific substances (i.e., high-molecular-weight proteins from plants and animal origins, or low-molecular-weight agents that include chemicals, metals and wood dusts) and occurs after a latency period of several weeks to years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''Irritant-induced'' (occupational) asthma is a non-immunologic form of asthma that results from a single or multiple high dose exposure to irritant products. It is usually develops early after exposure; however can also develop insidiously over a few months after a massive exposure to a complex mixture of alkaline dust and combustion products, as shown in the [[World Trade Center lung|World Trade Center disaster]]. Unlike those with sensitizer-induced occupational asthma, subjects with irritant-induced occupational asthma do not develop work-related asthma symptoms after re-exposure to low concentrations of the irritant that initiated the symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; [[Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome]] (RADS) is a severe form of irritant induced asthma where respiratory symptoms usually develop in the minutes or hours after a single accidental inhalation of a high concentration of irritant gas, aerosol, vapor, or smoke.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tarlo|first1=Susan M.|last2=Lemiere|first2=Catherine|date=2014-02-13|title=Occupational asthma|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=370|issue=7|pages=640–649|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1301758|issn=1533-4406|pmid=24521110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of work-related asthma is ''work-exacerbated asthma'' (WEA) which is asthma worsened by workplace conditions but not caused by it. WEA is present in about a fifth of patients with asthma and a wide variety of conditions at work, including irritant chemicals, dusts, second-hand smoke, common allergens that may be present at work, as well as other "exposures" such as emotional stress, worksite temperature, and physical exertion can exacerbate asthma symptoms in these patients.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Henneberger|first1=Paul K.|last2=Redlich|first2=Carrie A.|last3=Callahan|first3=David B.|last4=Harber|first4=Philip|last5=Lemière|first5=Catherine|last6=Martin|first6=James|last7=Tarlo|first7=Susan M.|last8=Vandenplas|first8=Olivier|last9=Torén|first9=Kjell|date=2011-08-01|title=An official american thoracic society statement: work-exacerbated asthma|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|volume=184|issue=3|pages=368–378|doi=10.1164/rccm.812011ST|issn=1535-4970|pmid=21804122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both occupational asthma and work-exacerbated asthma can be present in an individual.

A number of diseases have symptoms that mimic occupational asthma, such as [[asthma]] due to nonoccupational causes, [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), irritable larynx syndrome, [[hyperventilation syndrome]], [[hypersensitivity pneumonitis]], and [[bronchiolitis obliterans]].

== Signs and symptoms ==
Like other types of asthma, it is characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airways obstruction, and bronchospasm, but it is caused by something in the workplace environment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/asthma/|title=Asthma &amp; Allergies|date=April 3, 2012|publisher=NIOSH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include [[shortness of breath]], tightness of the chest, [[coughing]], sputum production and [[wheezing]]. Some patients may also develop upper airway symptoms such as itchy eyes, tearing, sneezing, nasal congestion and [[rhinorrhea]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Symptoms may develop over many years as in sensitizer induced asthma or may occur after a single exposure to a high-concentration agent as in case of RADS.

== Risk factors==
At present, over 400 workplace substances have been identified as having asthmagenic or allergenic properties.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Murray &amp; Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine|publisher=Elsevier|year=2016|isbn=9781455733835|pages=1295–1306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asmanet.com/asmapro/agents.htm (T78) Occupational Asthma : Table of agents, products and substances which can cause asthma&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=Xaver|last2=Bakehe|first2=Prudence|date=May 2014|title=Allergens causing occupational asthma: an evidence-based evaluation of the literature|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|volume=87|issue=4|pages=339–363|doi=10.1007/s00420-013-0866-9|issn=1432-1246|pmid=23595938|s2cid=38640302 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents such as flour, diisocyanates, latex, persulfate salts, aldehydes, animals, wood dusts, metals, enzymes usually account for the majority cases, however, the distribution of causal agents may vary widely across geographic areas, depending on the pattern of industrial activities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, in [[France]] the industries most affected are bakeries and cake-shops, [[automobile industry]] and hairdressers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/oem.60.2.136  |vauthors=Ameille J, Pauli G, Calastreng-Crinquand A, etal |title=Reported incidence of occupational asthma in France, 1996–99: the ONAP programme |journal=Occup Environ Med |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=136–41 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12554842 |pmc=1740458 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Canada the principal cause is wood dust, followed by [[isocyanates]].

== Diagnosis==
To diagnose occupational asthma it is necessary to confirm the symptoms of asthma and establish the causal connection with the work environment.  Various diagnostic tests can be used to aid in diagnoses of work related asthma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Baur|first1=X.|last2=Sigsgaard|first2=T.|last3=Aasen|first3=T. B.|last4=Burge|first4=P. S.|last5=Heederik|first5=D.|last6=Henneberger|first6=P.|last7=Maestrelli|first7=P.|last8=Rooyackers|first8=J.|last9=Schlünssen|first9=V.|date=2012-03-01|title=Guidelines for the management of work-related asthma|journal=European Respiratory Journal|language=en|volume=39|issue=3|pages=529–545|doi=10.1183/09031936.00096111|issn=0903-1936|pmid=22379148|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dwc/MTUS/ACOEM-Guidelines/Occupational-Work-Related-Asthma-Guideline.pdf|title=Occupational/Work-Related Asthma Medical Treatment Guideline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[spirometer]] is a device used to measure timed expired and inspired volumes, and can be used to help diagnose asthma.

[[Peak expiratory flow rate]] (PEFR) is a hand held device which measures  how fast a person can exhale and is a reliable test for occupational asthma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Moscato|first1=G.|last2=Godnic-Cvar|first2=J.|last3=Maestrelli|first3=P.|last4=Malo|first4=J. L.|last5=Burge|first5=P. S.|last6=Coifman|first6=R.|date=September 1995|title=Statement on self-monitoring of peak expiratory flows in the investigation of occupational asthma.

American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology|journal=The European Respiratory Journal|volume=8|issue=9|pages=1605–1610|doi=10.1183/09031936.95.08091605 |issn=0903-1936|pmid=8575590|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serial PEFR can be measured to see if there is a difference in ability to exhale at work compared to that in a controlled environment.

A non-specific [[bronchial hyperreactivity]] test can be used to support the diagnose occupational asthma. It involves measuring the [[forced expiratory volume]] in 1 second (FEV-1) of the patient before and after exposure to [[methacholine]] or mannitol. Presence of airway responsiveness i.e. significant drop in FEV-1 can be seen in patients with occupational asthma.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Specific inhalation challenge]]s test consist of exposing the subjects to the suspected occupational agent in the laboratory and/or at the workplace and assess for asthma symptoms as well as a reduction in FEV&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Vandenplas|first1=Olivier|last2=Suojalehto|first2=Hille|last3=Aasen|first3=Tor B.|last4=Baur|first4=Xaver|last5=Burge|first5=P.

Other tests such as [[skin prick test]], serum immunologic testing and measurement of sputum [[eosinophil]]s can also be useful in establishing the diagnosis of occupational asthma.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Prevention ==
Several forms of preventive measures have been suggested to prevent development of occupational asthma and also detect risk or disease early to allow intervention and improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tarlo|first1=Susan M.|last2=Liss|first2=Gary M.|date=July 2010|title=Prevention of occupational asthma|journal=Current Allergy and Asthma Reports|volume=10|issue=4|pages=278–286|doi=10.1007/s11882-010-0118-y|issn=1534-6315|pmid=20424999|s2cid=20166471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: comprehensive programs, education and training, medical examinations, use of medications, reduction of exposures and elimination of exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/asthma/occasthmaprevention-query1.html|title=NIOSH: Prevention of Work-related Asthma|date=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review on the effectiveness of prevention measurements indicated that removal or reduction of exposure may improve asthma symptoms when compared to uninterrupted exposure.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Henneberger |first1=Paul K |last2=Patel |first2=Jenil R |last3=de Groene |first3=Gerda J |last4=Beach |first4=Jeremy |last5=Tarlo |first5=Susan M |last6=Pal |first6=Teake M |last7=Curti |first7=Stefania |date=2019-10-08 |editor-last=Cochrane Work Group |title=Workplace interventions for treatment of occupational asthma |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume=10 |issue=10 |pages=CD006308 |language=en |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub4 |pmc=6781842 |pmid=31593318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal from exposure may improve lung function when compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure may improve symptoms and lung function more than reduction of exposure among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents, such as [[Isocyanate|isocyanates]], [[Diisocyanate|diisocyanates]], [[plicatic acid]], [[Metal|metals]] and [[anhydrides]]. Two studies reported an increased of job loss associated with removal from exposure. Four studies reported a decrease in income of 20% to 50% after removal from exposure. The authors suggested that the benefit of a better improvement in air quality be weighed against the potential for a higher risk of job loss.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

[[File:Research to Inform the Prevention of Asthma in Health Care – Research Study.webm|thumb|A video on research on preventing asthma in health care]]
Asthma symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness can persist for several years after removal from the offending environment.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Thus, early restriction from exposure to the trigger is advisable. Completely stopping exposure is more effective treatment than reducing exposure, but not always feasible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Workplace interventions for treatment of occupational asthma|journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date = 2011|issn = 1469-493X|pmid = 21563151|pages = CD006308|issue = 5|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006308.pub3|first1 = Gerda J.|last1 = de Groene|first2 = Teake M.|last2 = Pal|first3 = Jeremy|last3 = Beach|first4 = Susan M.|last4 = Tarlo|first5 = Dick|last5 = Spreeuwers|first6 = Monique Hw|last6 = Frings-Dresen|first7 = Stefano|last7 = Mattioli|first8 = Jos H.|last8 = Verbeek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
===Medication===

Medications used for occupational asthma are similar to those used for other types of asthma such as short-acting [[beta-agonist]]s like [[salbutamol]] or [[terbutaline]],  long-acting beta-agonists like [[salmeterol]] and [[formoterol]] and inhaled [[corticosteroid]]s. Immunotherapy can also be used in some cases of sensitizer induced occupational asthma.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Occupational asthma is one of the most common occupational lung disease. Approximately 17% of all adult-onset asthma cases are related to occupational exposures.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/asthma/epidemiology.html|title=NIOSH: Work-related asthma|date=2019-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one fourth of adults with asthma have work-exacerbated asthma.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Patients with work-related asthma are more likely to experience asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and worsening of their asthma symptoms compared with other adult asthma patients.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Society and culture==

=== Compensation ===

When a person is diagnosed with occupational asthma, it can result in serious socio-economic consequences not only for the workers but also for the employer and the healthcare system because the worker must change positions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowl|first=Clayton T.|title=Occupational Asthma|journal=Chest|volume=139|issue=3|pages=674–681|doi=10.1378/chest.10-0079|pmid=21362654|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The probability of being re-employed is lower for those with occupational asthma compared to those with normal asthma. The employer not only pays compensation to the employee, but will also have to spend a considerable amount of time and energy and funds for hiring and training new personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000110.htm|publisher= MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|title=Occuptational Asthma}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dewitte JD, Chan-Yeung M, Malo JL |title=Medicolegal and compensation aspects of occupational asthma |journal=Eur. Respir. J. |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=969–80 |date=May 1994 |doi=10.1183/09031936.94.07050969 |pmid=8050556 |s2cid=41120422 |url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8050556|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it was estimated that the direct cost of occupational asthma in 1996 was $1.2 billion and the indirect cost $0.4 billion, for a total cost of $1.6 billion. In most cases, the employer could have saved more money by adhering to safety standards rather than causing employees to become injured.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1378/chest.121.1.264 |vauthors=Leigh JP, Romano PS, Schenker MB, Kreiss K |author3-link=Marc B. Schenker |title=Costs of occupational COPD and asthma |journal=Chest |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=264–72 |date=January 2002 |pmid=11796461 |url=http://chestjournal.chestpubs.org/content/121/1/264.long|citeseerx=10.1.1.455.4942 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this can entail severe socio-economic consequences for the worker as well as the employer due to loss of job, unemployment, compensation issues, medical expenditures, and hiring and re-training of new personnel.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''''Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus''''' is an [[Educational video game|educational]] [[Platform game|platform]] [[video game]] developed by American studio WaveQuest and published by Raya Systems for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. It is a part of educational video game series from Raya that includes ''[[Captain Novolin]]'', ''[[Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon]]'' and ''[[Packy and Marlon]]''.

==Gameplay and plot==
The game attempts to teach children about [[asthma]]. Years ago, meteors struck the [[prehistory|prehistoric]] city of San Saurian. The explosions covered the earth with clouds of dust, thus causing asthma in the [[dinosaur]] world. The dinosaurs built a mighty wind machine to clear the air, but their plans were thwarted by Mr. Rexo, who stole the machine, hid its pieces over San Saurian and forced other dinosaurs to protect them. The two friends, Bronkie and Trakie, with the help of their sidekicks, Sam and Kyla, must find the missing machine parts before the dust returns and save the planet. Bronkie and Trakie can develop shortness of breath from tar, cigarette smoke, furry animals, and other obstacles. Bonus games include learning the proper use of the [[inhaler]] and other daily facts of life for people with asthma.

'''Type 2 inflammation''' is a pattern of [[immune response]]. Its physiological function is to defend the body against [[Parasitic worm|helminths]], but a dysregulation of the type 2 inflammatory response has been implicated in the [[pathophysiology]] of several diseases.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-08-01|title=Host protective roles of type 2 immunity: Parasite killing and tissue repair, flip sides of the same coin|journal=Seminars in Immunology|language=en|volume=26|issue=4|pages=329–340|doi=10.1016/j.smim.2014.06.003|issn=1044-5323|pmc=4179909|pmid=25028340|last1=Allen|first1=Judith E.|last2=Sutherland|first2=Tara E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Namita A.|last2=Bennett|first2=Brandy L.|last3=Graham|first3=Neil M.

== Molecular biology ==
[[Interleukin 25|IL-25]], [[Interleukin 33|IL-33]], and [[Thymic stromal lymphopoietin|TSLP]] are [[Damage-associated molecular pattern|alarmins]] released from damaged epithelial cells. These [[Cytokine|cytokines]] mediate the activation of type 2 [[T helper cell|T helper cells]] (T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells), [[ILC2|type 2 innate lymphoid cells]] (ILC2 cells), and [[Dendritic cell|dendritic cells]]. T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells and ILC2 cells secrete [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], [[Interleukin 5|IL-5]] and [[Interleukin 13|IL-13]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hong|first1=Haiyu|last2=Liao|first2=Shumin|last3=Chen|first3=Fenghong|last4=Yang|first4=Qintai|last5=Wang|first5=De-Yun|date=2020|title=Role of IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP in triggering united airway diseases toward type 2 inflammation|journal=Allergy|language=en|volume=75|issue=11|pages=2794–2804|doi=10.1111/all.14526|pmid=32737888|s2cid=220908481|issn=1398-9995|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IL-4 further drives CD4+ T cell differentiation towards the T&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;2 subtype and induces [[Immunoglobulin class switching|isotype switching]] to IgE in B cells. IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate trafficking of eosinophils to the site of inflammation, while IL-5 promotes both eosinophil trafficking and production.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Asthma triggers''' are factors or stimuli that provoke the exacerbation of [[asthma]] symptoms or increase the degree of airflow disruption, which can lead to an [[asthma attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Trigger |url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/trigger |work=McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine |access-date=2022-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; An asthma attack is characterized by an [[Airway obstruction|obstruction of the airway]], [[Secretion|hypersecretion]] of [[mucus]] and [[bronchoconstriction]] due to the contraction of [[smooth muscle]]s around the [[respiratory tract]]. Its symptoms include a wide range of manifestations such as [[Shortness of breath|breathlessness]], [[cough]]ing, a tight chest and [[Wheeze|wheezing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=British Thoracic Society |last2=Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network |date=2014 |title=British guideline on the management of asthma |url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25323740/ |journal=Thorax |volume=69 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=1–192 |issn=1468-3296 |pmid=25323740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An asthma attack is usually mediated by an [[Inflammation|inflammatory pathway]], where a trigger such as an [[allergen]] could lead to a series of immune response mediated by various types of immune cells.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Common triggers for asthma include [[allergen]]s like pet dander, [[House dust mite|dust mites]], [[pollen]]s and [[Mold|molds]]. Other types of triggers like [[Exercise physiology|exercise]], [[Air pollution|air pollutants]], [[tobacco smoke]], [[humidity]], cold air, or certain medicines may also play a role in triggering asthma.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Vernon |first1=Margaret K. |last2=Wiklund |first2=Ingela |last3=Bell |first3=Jill A. |last4=Dale |first4=Peter |last5=Chapman |first5=Kenneth R. |date=2012-11-19 |title=What Do We Know about Asthma Triggers?

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Asthma attack-illustration NIH.jpg|thumb|Figure showing the physiological changes in the respiratory tract during an asthma attack upon contact with a trigger]]The pathophysiology for asthma mainly involves the inflammatory pathway, associated with several types of immune cells in the body, mainly [[T helper cell|T helper 2 cells]] (Th2 cells), [[B cell]]s and [[mast cell]]s. In a nut shell, as a stimulus, such as an allergen comes into contact with an asthma patient, it activates various types of immune cells leading to an [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]], causing [[bronchial hyperresponsiveness]], [[bronchoconstriction]], excessive [[mucus]] secretion, airflow obstruction and an asthma attack.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A more detail rundown of the process is provided below.

=== Allergic triggers ===
[[Allergy|Allergic]] triggers are factors or chemicals that could induce airway sensitization, [[inflammation]], [[bronchospasm]] and other asthmatic symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=D'Amato |first1=M |last2=Cecchi |first2=L |last3=Annesi-Maesano |first3=I |last4=D'Amato |first4=G |date=2018-04-16 |title=News on Climate Change, Air Pollution, and Allergic Triggers of Asthma |journal=Journal of Investigational Allergology and Clinical Immunology |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=91–97 |doi=10.18176/jiaci.0228 |pmid=29345235 |issn=1018-9068|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allergens are the most common trigger for allergic asthma.

[[Occupational asthma]] refers to a type of asthma that is resulted from repeated exposure to an agent that causes or exacerbates asthma in a workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tarlo |first1=Susan M. |last2=Lemiere |first2=Catherine |date=2014-02-13 |title=Occupational Asthma |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/nejmra1301758 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=370 |issue=7 |pages=640–649 |doi=10.1056/nejmra1301758 |pmid=24521110 |issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the primary cause for occupational asthma varies from situation to situation, common agents such as [[metal]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[cleaning agent]]s, [[Dimethyl sulfate|dimethylsulphate]], [[diisocyanate]]s, [[latex]], [[persulfate]], [[aldehyde]]s, [[isocyanate]]s, [[wood dust]]s and [[flour]] should be handled with great care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1997 |title=Handling fish can cause occupational asthma |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0278-6915(97)90051-x |journal=Food and Chemical Toxicology |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=930 |doi=10.1016/s0278-6915(97)90051-x |issn=0278-6915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Baur |first1=Xaver |last2=Bakehe |first2=Prudence |date=2014 |title=Allergens causing occupational asthma: an evidence-based evaluation of the literature |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00420-013-0866-9 |journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |language=en |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=339–363 |doi=10.1007/s00420-013-0866-9 |pmid=23595938 |s2cid=38640302 |issn=0340-0131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Labrecque |first=Manon |date=2012 |title=Irritant-induced asthma |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/aci.0b013e32835143b8 |journal=Current Opinion in Allergy &amp; Clinical Immunology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=140–144 |doi=10.1097/aci.0b013e32835143b8 |pmid=22327170 |s2cid=28763190 |issn=1528-4050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tobacco smoke ===
Both first-hand and second-hand [[tobacco smoke]] can be a trigger for asthma attack.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web |last= |date=2022-02-11 |title=Asthma and Secondhand Smoke |url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/secondhand-smoke-asthma.html |access-date=2022-03-29 |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may worsen the condition of asthma as it is an irritant and induces bronchoconstriction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Pietinalho |first1=A. |last2=Pelkonen |first2=A. |last3=Rytilä |first3=P. |date=2009-10-12 |title=Linkage between smoking and asthma |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02208.x |journal=Allergy |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=1722–1727 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02208.x |pmid=19832738 |s2cid=40233991 |issn=0105-4538}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological triggers ===
Studies have also indicated that [[psychological stress]] may be associated with a higher chance of asthma attack.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Patients with psychological stress are found to have a reduced awareness of controlling asthma and a less desirable physical health.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Van Lieshout |first1=Ryan J |last2=MacQueen |first2=Glenda |date=2008 |title=Psychological Factors in Asthma |journal=Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology |language=en |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=12–28 |doi=10.1186/1710-1492-4-1-12 |issn=1710-1492 |pmc=2869336 |pmid=20525122 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptom ==
One of the clinical asthmatic symptoms is [[shortness of breath]] due to narrowing of the respiratory tract, caused by [[mucus]] plug formation and [[bronchoconstriction]] as [[smooth muscle]]s contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2022-03-23 |title=Erratum: Mechanisms of Particles in Sensitization, Effector Function and Therapy of Allergic Disease |journal=Frontiers in Immunology |volume=13 |page=891445 |doi=10.3389/fimmu.2022.891445 |pmid=35401505 |pmc=8985158 |issn=1664-3224|doi-access=free |last1=Frontiers Production |first1=Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another typical symptom is [[Wheeze|wheezing]]. During expiration, turbulent airflow crushes the narrowed respiratory tract, leading to a wheezing sound.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Parker |first=R. |date=2007-08-01 |title=Gibson P. Evidence-based respiratory medicine.

== Avoidance ==
Understanding the specific asthma triggers for a patient and avoiding them can be a simple way for preventing an asthma attack.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Regularly washing [[bedding]]s, quitting [[smoking]], doing [[Pest control|pest]] controls, keeping a sensitized living environment, removing [[Water stagnation|stagnant water]], avoiding products with potential [[Irritation|irritants]], etc., can be effective in avoiding an asthma attack.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Education about asthma triggers should be done by physicians to help patients understand what activities or materials should be avoided. Reduction of exposure to asthma triggers should be done by asthmatic patient as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Parents of asthmatic children should also be cautious of common asthma triggers in order to reduce risks of an asthma attack.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
[[File:Asthma Medication Inhaler.JPG|thumb|Image of an asthma medication inhaler which can be used to administer the medicine through the pulmonary route]]

=== Quick-relief medicine ===
Quick-relief medicine are used for treating an acute asthma attack. The first line of medicine for treating this situation is short-term [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta-2-adrenoreceptor agonists]], which are drugs that can stimulate the beta-2 adrenergic receptors. They are [[bronchodilator]]s and can effectively relieve the symptoms by clearing the airway. Examples include [[Salbutamol|albuterol]] and [[Levosalbutamol|levalbuterol]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Bissell |first1=Karen |last2=Ellwood |first2=Philippa |last3=Ellwood |first3=Eamon |last4=Chiang |first4=Chen-Yuan |last5=Marks |first5=Guy |last6=El Sony |first6=Asma |last7=Asher |first7=Innes |last8=Billo |first8=Nils |last9=Perrin |first9=Christophe |date=2019-02-19 |title=Essential Medicines at the National Level: The Global Asthma Network's Essential Asthma Medicines Survey 2014 |journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=605 |doi=10.3390/ijerph16040605 |pmid=30791442 |pmc=6406388 |issn=1660-4601|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly they are used with a portable inhaler which allow the patient to administer the medicine at once during an attack.

Another common medicine for an acute attack is [[anticholinergic]] drugs such as [[Ipratropium bromide|ipratropium]] and [[Tiotropium bromide|tiotropium]], which are also [[bronchodilator]]s.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; They work by blocking off the [[Acetylcholine receptor|cholinergic receptors]] and reduces [[mucus]] secretion and [[bronchoconstriction]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Another type of treatment for acute asthma attack is [[Immunosuppression|immunosuppressive]] drugs like [[corticosteroid]]s, which can also alleviate an asthmatic response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Djukanović |first1=Ratko |last2=Wilson |first2=John W. |last3=Britten |first3=Karen M. |last4=Wilson |first4=Susan J. |last5=Walls |first5=Andrew F. |last6=Roche |first6=William R. |last7=Howarth |first7=Peter H. |last8=Holgate |first8=Stephen T. |date=1992 |title=Effect of an Inhaled Corticosteroid on Airway Inflammation and Symptoms in Asthma |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm/145.3.669 |journal=American Review of Respiratory Disease |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=669–674 |doi=10.1164/ajrccm/145.3.669 |pmid=1546849 |issn=0003-0805}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include prednisone and methyl prednisone which are usually administered orally or intravenously for treating an acute situation.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; However, note that long term use of corticosteroids may lead to severe side effects.

=== Long-term control ===
Continuous and long-term use of certain medicines can help reduce the risk of an asthma attack and keep the disease under control.
[[File:Prednisolone.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of prednisolone, a corticosteroid that can help relief an acute asthma attack]]
Long term use of certain types of corticosteroids, such as [[fluticasone propionate]] may be administered through the pulmonary route to reduce the risk of an asthma attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=TW |last2=Oborne |first2=J |last3=Newton |first3=S |last4=Tattersfield |first4=AE |date=2004 |title=Doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: randomised controlled trial |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(03)15384-6 |journal=The Lancet |volume=363 |issue=9405 |pages=271–275 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)15384-6 |pmid=14751699 |s2cid=28581643 |issn=0140-6736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral use of [[Antileukotriene|leukotriene receptor antagonist]] such as [[Zafirlukast]] may also be used as a long term control for asthma in addition to corticosteroids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Choi |first1=Jaehwa |title=Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists |date=2023 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554445/ |work=StatPearls |access-date=2023-06-20 |place=Treasure Island (FL) |publisher=StatPearls Publishing |pmid=32119332 |last2=Azmat |first2=Chaudhary Ehtsham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=thuốc trị hen suyễn |url=https://thuocnampqa.vn/thuoc-dieu-tri-hen-phe-quan |access-date=20 June 2023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, another option is the use of [[Cromoglicic acid|cromolyn sodium]], which can prevent an asthma attack by halting Ca2+ influx, thus preventing [[mast cell]] degranulation and subsequent asthmatic complications &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Georgopoulos |first1=Dimitris |last2=Giulekas |first2=Dimitris |last3=Ilonidis |first3=George |last4=Sichletidis |first4=Lazaws |date=1989 |title=Effect of Salbutamol, Ipratropium Bromide and Cromolyn Sodium on Prostaglandin F2α -Induced Bronchospasm |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1378/chest.96.4.809 |journal=Chest |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=809–814 |doi=10.1378/chest.96.4.809 |pmid=2529105 |issn=0012-3692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than drugs, an alternative treatment method is [[Desensitization (medicine)|de-sensitization]], which involves exposure to a well-controlled, small and increasing amounts of specific allergen over a long duration of time.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Krishna |first1=M T |last2=Huissoon |first2=A P |date=2010-12-22 |title=Clinical immunology review series: an approach to desensitization |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04296.x |journal=Clinical and Experimental Immunology |volume=163 |issue=2 |pages=131–146 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2249.2010.04296.x |pmid=21175592 |pmc=3043304 |issn=0009-9104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is to trigger antigen competition by the development of allergen-specific [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] antibodies, which can reduce to risk of an allergic response.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

[[Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist|Long-acting beta-agonists]] such as [[Salmeterol|salmetrol]] had been used in combination with [[corticosteroid]]s to control asthma symptoms. They are drugs that can stimulate the [[beta-2 adrenergic receptor]]s and mediate a [[Bronchodilator|bronchodilation]] effect for over 12 hours. However, a recent study in 2010 has found that this treatment method could increase the risk of asthma-related deaths and intubations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Salpeter |first1=Shelley R. |last2=Wall |first2=Andrew J. |last3=Buckley |first3=Nicholas S. |date=2010 |title=Long-acting Beta-Agonists with and without Inhaled Corticosteroids and Catastrophic Asthma Events |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002934309011103 |journal=The American Journal of Medicine |language=en |volume=123 |issue=4 |pages=322–328.e2 |doi=10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.07.035|pmid=20176343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration (FDA)]] is also recommending the discontinuation of the drug if asthma control has been achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Badrul A. |last2=Dal Pan |first2=Gerald |date=2010 |title=The FDA and Safe Use of Long-Acting Beta-Agonists in the Treatment of Asthma |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMp1002074 |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |language=en |volume=362 |issue=13 |pages=1169–1171 |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1002074 |pmid=20181964 |issn=0028-4793|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Asthma-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Overlap''' (ACO), also known as Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) is a chronic inflammatory, obstructive airway disease in which features of both [[asthma]] and [[COPD]] predominate. Asthma and COPD were once thought of as distinct entities, however in some, there are clinical features of both asthma and COPD with significant overlap in pathophysiology and symptom profile. It is unclear whether ACO is a separate disease entity or a clinical subtype of asthma and COPD. The pathogenesis of ACO is poorly understood, but it is thought to involve both [[type 2 inflammation]] (usually seen in asthma) as well as type 1 inflammation (seen in COPD). The incidence and prevalence of ACO are not well known. The risk factors for ACO are also incompletely understood, but tobacco smoke is known to be a major risk factor.

== Signs and Symptoms ==
ACO presents with symptoms of both [[asthma]] and [[COPD]].&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Postma |first1=Dirkje S. |last2=Rabe |first2=Klaus F. |title=The Asthma–COPD Overlap Syndrome |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=24 September 2015 |volume=373 |issue=13 |pages=1241–9 |pmid=26398072 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra1411863}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACO presents in adulthood, usually after the age of 40 (after there has been significant tobacco smoke or other toxic fumes exposure), with symptoms of [[dyspnea]] (shortness of breath), [[exercise intolerance]], [[mucous|mucous production]], [[cough]] and episodes of symptomatic worsening known as exacerbations.

== Cause ==
A history of significant and persistent noxious fumes exposure is required for the diagnosis of COPD, therefore is also required for the diagnosis of ACO.&lt;ref name="Chest 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cosio |first1=Borja G. |last2=Soriano |first2=Joan B. |last3=López-Campos |first3=Jose Luis |last4=Calle-Rubio |first4=Myriam |last5=Soler-Cataluna |first5=Juan José |last6=de-Torres |first6=Juan P. |last7=Marín |first7=Jose M. |last8=Martínez-Gonzalez |first8=Cristina |last9=de Lucas |first9=Pilar |last10=Mir |first10=Isabel |last11=Peces-Barba |first11=Germán |last12=Feu-Collado |first12=Nuria |last13=Solanes |first13=Ingrid |last14=Alfageme |first14=Inmaculada |last15=Casanova |first15=Ciro |last16=Calvo Bonachera |first16=José |last17=Lacárcel Bautista |first17=Celia |last18=Domenech |first18=Adolfo |last19=Guzmán |first19=Rosirys |last20=Irigaray |first20=Rosa |last21=Zamora |first21=Meritxell López |last22=Ríos |first22=Angel |last23=Córdova |first23=Rocío |last24=López |first24=Carlos Cabrera |last25=Acosta |first25=Alejandro Sánchez |last26=González |first26=Juan Abreu |last27=Balbin |first27=Ramón Agüero |last28=Balcells |first28=Eva |last29=Campos |first29=Elena Miguel |last30=Marin |first30=Alicia |last31=Casanova |first31=Antonia Llunel |last32=Moreno |first32=Amalia |last33=Márquez Pérez |first33=Francisca Lourdes |last34=Riesco Miranda |first34=Juan Antonio |last35=Rodríguez |first35=Julia Tabara |last36=Gómez |first36=Rafael Golpe |last37=de Miguel Díez |first37=Javier |last38=Río |first38=Francisco García |last39=Lobato |first39=Salvador Díaz |last40=Galdiz Iturri |first40=Juan Bautista |last41=Royo |first41=Margarita Marín |last42=de Diego Damia |first42=Alfredo |title=Defining the Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome in a COPD Cohort |journal=Chest |date=January 2016 |volume=149 |issue=1 |pages=45–52 |pmid=26291753 |doi=10.1378/chest.15-1055}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be due to tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution or outdoor air pollution.

== Pathophysiology ==
ACOS presents with features of both asthma and COPD. Both asthma and COPD (as well as ACO) present with exacerbations, periods where symptoms deteriorate, with marked reductions in airflow. However,  in asthma, the airflow limitation usually completely resolves after exacerbations, whereas in COPD it may not.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; ACO presents with a chronic airflow limitation or obstruction (due to inflammation), with characteristics of both asthma and COPD. Inflammation of the large and medium airways (classically seen with asthma) is seen in ACO.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; This consists of bronchoconstriction due to smooth muscle spasm as well as smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness (due to allergens or irritants) causing obstruction of airflow.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; Mucous production and inflammation in the airways can also cause airflow obstruction in asthma.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt;

Features of COPD (which includes the subtypes of chronic bronchitis and COPD) are also seen in ACO. These include the features of chronic bronchitis such as inflammation of the small airways and mucous production or hypersecretion.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; [[Bronchioles|Peribronchial]] inflammation, which may lead to fibrosis ([[obliterative bronchiolitis]]).&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; As well as features of emphysema including inflammation leading to [[alveoli|alveolar]] destruction resulting in lung hyperinflation and air trapping.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
There are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria for ACO, however the diagnosis requires clinical features of both asthma and COPD.&lt;ref name="GOLD"&gt;{{cite web |title=Asthma, COPD, and Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome |url=https://goldcopd.org/asthma-copd-asthma-copd-overlap-syndrome/ |website=Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease - GOLD}}&lt;/ref&gt; One diagnostic criteria, based on expert consensus, first described in 2016, requires the presence of 3 major and at least 1 minor criteria for the diagnosis of ACO. The major criteria are: a persistent airflow limitation (a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second divided by forced vital capacity ([[FEV1/FVC]]) of less than 0.7 or below the lower limit of normal), a significant exposure history to tobacco smoke (defined as a greater than 10 pack year history)(or significant exposure to other indoor or outdoor air pollution) and a documented history of asthma or a significant improvement in FEV1 (of greater than 400mL) to an inhaled bronchodilator.&lt;ref name=Mekov21&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mekov |first1=Evgeni |last2=Nuñez |first2=Alexa |last3=Sin |first3=Don D |last4=Ichinose |first4=Masakazu |last5=Rhee |first5=Chin Kook |last6=Maselli |first6=Diego Jose |last7=Coté |first7=Andréanne |last8=Suppli Ulrik |first8=Charlotte |last9=Maltais |first9=François |last10=Anzueto |first10=Antonio |last11=Miravitlles |first11=Marc |title=Update on Asthma–COPD Overlap (ACO): A Narrative Review |journal=International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease |date=June 2021 |volume=16 |pages=1783–99 |pmid=34168440 |pmc=8216660 |doi=10.2147/COPD.S312560 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The minor criteria include a history of atopy or allergic rhinitis, a more limited response to an inhaled bronchodilator (greater than 200 mL improvement in the FEV1 or a 12% improvement from baseline), and peripheral blood [[eosinophil]]s greater than 300 cells/μL. [[Spirometry]] (documenting obstruction) is required for the diagnosis of ACO.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt;

In those with asthma, some features often seen in COPD that may aid in the diagnosis of ACO include emphysema seen on imaging or a decreased diffusion capacity ([[DLCO]])(indicating significant lung tissue damage). In those with COPD, other features often seen in asthma that may aid in the diagnosis of ACO include an increase in the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide ([[FENO]])(a marker that is specific to the degree of airway inflammation in those with asthma) or increased levels of [[IgE]] (either total IgE or specific to inhaled antigens).&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt;

== Treatment ==
Treatment of ACO is based on expert opinion as there are no universally accepted clinical guidelines. Treatment is usually based on whether clinical features of asthma or COPD predominate.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; Inhaled corticosteroids are the primary treatment in those with ACOS.&lt;ref name="Chest 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be continued in those with asthma who develop decreased airway responsiveness to bronchodilators consistent with ACO.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; Therapy can be escalated to include a long acting beta-agonist (LABA) and inhaled steroid combination (ICS-LABA) or by adding on a long-acting anti-muscarinic inhaler (LAMA), known as triple therapy, in those with more severe or resistant disease.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt;

Monoclonal antibodies targeting [[type 2 inflammation]] (which is predominant in asthma) have been used to treat severe asthma, and may also be used in severe cases of ACO.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; These monoclonal antibodies include [[omalizumab]] (an Anti-IgE antibody), [[mepolizumab]] (an anti-IL-5 antibody) and [[benralizumab]] (an anti-IL-5 receptor α antibody).&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; People with ACOS and eosinophilia have a better response to ICS; with fewer exacerbations and hospitalizations seen in ACOS treated with long term ICS.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt; Systemic corticosteroids ([[intravenous]] or oral steroids) may be used during exacerbations of ACOS.&lt;ref name="NEJM 2015 Postma" /&gt;

== Prognosis ==
The progression of permanent airflow obstruction (as measured by the rate of FEV1 decline) is slower in ACO as compared to COPD, but ACO with late onset asthma is associated with a more rapid FEV1 decline (a more rapid progression of obstruction) and a worse prognosis.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; ACO  with late onset asthma is associated with a higher mortality as compared to COPD, asthma or healthy controls.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; Excluding ACO with late onset asthma, ACO has better survival (lower mortality) than COPD, but higher mortality compared to asthma.&lt;ref name=Mekov21/&gt; In other studies, ACO was associated with worse [[dyspnea]] symptoms, more coughing, wheezing, sputum production as well as more frequent and more severe exacerbations as compared to COPD or asthma.&lt;ref name="Nielsen International Journal of COPD 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ulrik |first1=Charlotte Suppli |last2=Nielsen |first2=Mia |last3=Bårnes |first3=Camilla Boslev |title=Clinical characteristics of the asthma–COPD overlap syndrome a systematic review |journal=International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease |date=July 2015 |volume=10 |pages=1443–1454 |pmid=26251584 |pmc=4524387 |doi=10.2147/COPD.S85363 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology ==
Due to heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria and a paucity of clinical trials, the prevalence of ACO is not well known. Based on a meta analysis, the prevalence of ACO in the general population is estimated to be 2%, whereas the prevalence of ACO in those with asthma is 26.5% and in those with COPD it is 29.6%.&lt;ref name="Hosseini 2019"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hosseini |first1=Mostafa |last2=Almasi-Hashiani |first2=Amir |last3=Sepidarkish |first3=Mahdi |last4=Maroufizadeh |first4=Saman |title=Global prevalence of asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) in the general population: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Respiratory Research |date=December 2019 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=229 |pmid=31647021 |pmc=6813073 |doi=10.1186/s12931-019-1198-4 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;
