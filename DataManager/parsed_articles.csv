Inhaler spacer,"A spacer is a device used to increase the ease of administering aerosolized medication from a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). It adds space in the form of a tube or ""chamber"" between the mouth and canister of medication. Most spacers have a one-way valve that allows the person to inhale the medication while inhaling and exhaling normally; these are often referred to as valved holding chambers (VHC).

AeroChamber, InspirEase and Volumatic are examples of a spacer.

Spacers help those unable to breathe deeply, as well as those unable to synchronize their breathing so that they inhale just as the MDI is actuated; the latter is known as poor ""hand-lung coordination"".

Terminology
The term spacer is often used to refer to any tube-like MDI add-on device. Some spacers (e.g., InspirEase) utilize a collapsing bag design to provide visual feedback that successful inspiration is taking place. Another type (e.g., Volumatic) is transparent plastic in two vase-shaped parts that come together forming a barrel shape. Valved holding chambers (VHC) are commonly called ""spacers"" as well. 

Application and benefits
Asthma Inhaler  Metered-dose inhaler (MDI); the mouthpiece slots into the back of the spacer.
To use an inhaler without a spacer requires coordinating several actions in a set order (pressing down on the inhaler, breathing in deeply as soon as the medication is released, holding your breath, exhaling), and not everyone is able to master this sequence. Use of a spacer, particularly a valved holding chamber, avoids such timing issues. Valved holding chambers are particularly useful for children, people with severe shortness of breath, and those with cognitive impairment.

After removing the MDI's cap, the MDI mouthpiece is inserted into the back of the spacer. The front part of the chamber is closed off by either a mouthpiece or a mask that covers the mouth and nose. To administer the medication, the MDI is depressed once, resulting in the release of one dose of medication. The medication from the MDI is then suspended in the spacer's chamber while the person inhales the aerosolized medication by breathing in and out. The exhaled breath exits the device through the valves rather than entering the chamber. Some spacers are equipped with a whistle, which sounds if the person is inhaling too quickly.

Spacers slow down the speed of the aerosol coming from the inhaler, meaning that less of the asthma drug impacts on the back of the mouth and somewhat more may get into the lungs. In the case of corticosteroids, less residue in the mouth reduces the risk of developing oral candidiasis, a yeast infection. Rinsing the mouth after application of inhaled steroids has a similar effect.

Whereas people with asthma can keep an MDI close-by at all times, the bulkiness of spacers can limit their use outside the home. Some research suggests that homemade spacers, using plastic bottles, may be as effective as commercially made versions, but homemade versions may have more variability."
World Asthma Day,"World Asthma Day is an annual event organized by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) to improve asthma awareness and care around the world. World Asthma Day is held on the first Tuesday in May. The theme of 2021's event was ""Uncovering Asthma Misconceptions,"" and for 2022, ""Closing Gaps in Asthma Care.""

The inaugural World Asthma Day was held in 1998."
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction,"Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) occurs when the airways narrow as a result of exercise.  This condition has been referred to as exercise-induced asthma (EIA), however this term is no longer preferred. While exercise does not cause asthma, it is frequently an asthma trigger.

It might be expected that people with E.I.B. would present with shortness of breath, and/or an elevated respiratory rate and wheezing, consistent with an asthma attack.  However, many will present with decreased stamina, or difficulty in recovering from exertion compared to team members, or paroxysmal coughing from an irritable airway.  Similarly, examination may reveal wheezing and  prolonged expiratory phase, or may be quite normal.  Consequently, a potential for under-diagnosis exists.  Measurement of airflow, such as peak expiratory flow rates, which can be done inexpensively on the track or sideline, may prove helpful. In athletes, symptoms of bronchospasm such as chest discomfort, breathlessness, and fatigue are often falsely attributed to the individual being “out of shape”, having asthma, or possessing a hyperreactive airway rather than EIB 

 Cause
While the potential triggering events for EIB are well recognized, the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. It usually occurs after at least several minutes of vigorous, aerobic activity, which increases oxygen demand to the point where breathing through the nose (nasal breathing) must be supplemented by mouth breathing.  The resultant inhalation of air that has not been warmed and humidified by the nasal passages seems to generate increased blood flow to the linings of the bronchial tree, resulting in edema.  Constriction of these small airways then follows, worsening the degree of obstruction to airflow.  There is increasing evidence that the smooth muscle that lines the airways becomes progressively more sensitive to changes that occur as a result of injury to the airways from dehydration.  The chemical mediators that provoke the muscle spasm appear to arise from mast cells. Mouth breathing as a result of decreased nasal breathing also increases lung surface exposure to irritants, pollutants, and allergens, causing neutrophilic inflammation in response to reactive oxygen species formation; research has found that individuals with genetically hindered glutathione counteraction of this oxidative stress are likely at a higher risk of developing EIB. 

Diagnosis
Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction can be difficult to diagnose clinically given the lack of specific symptoms and frequent misinterpretation as manifestations of vigorous exercise.  There are many mimics that present with similar symptoms, such as  Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO). The latter can co-exist with EIB and is best differentiated using objective testing and continuous laryngoscopy during exercise (CLE) testing. 

Spirometry
Objective testing should begin with spirometry at rest. In true exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, the results should be within normal limits. Should resting values be abnormal, then asthma, or some other chronic lung condition, is present. There is, of course, no reason why asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction should not co-exist but the distinction is important because without successful treatment of underlying asthma, treatment of an exercise component will likely be unsuccessful.  If baseline testing is normal, some form of exercise or pharmacologic stress will be required, either on the sideline or practice venue, or in the laboratory.

 Exercise testing 
Treadmill or ergometer-based testing in lung function laboratories are effective methods for diagnosing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, but may result in false negatives if the exercise stimulus is not intense enough.

 Field-exercise challenge 
Field-exercise challenge tests that involve the athlete performing the sport in which they are normally involved and assessing FEV1 after exercise are helpful if abnormal but have been shown to be less sensitive than eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation.

 Eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation challenge 
The Olympic athletes.  In the EVH challenge, the patient voluntarily, without exercising, rapidly breathes dry air enriched with 5%  for six minutes.  The presence of the enriched  compensates for the  losses in the expired air, not matched by metabolic production, that occurs during hyperventilation, and so maintains  levels at normal.

 Medication challenge 
Medication challenge tests, such as the methacholine challenge test, have a lower sensitivity for detection of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in athletes and are also not a recommended first-line approach in the evaluation of exercise-induced asthma.

Mannitol inhalation has been recently approved for use in the United States.

A relatively recent review of the literature has concluded that there is currently insufficient available evidence to conclude that either mannitol inhalation or eucapnic voluntary hyperventilation are suitable alternatives to exercise challenge testing to detect exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and that additional research is required.

Treatment


Lifestyle
The best treatment is avoidance of conditions predisposing to attacks, when possible.  In athletes who wish to continue their sport or do so in adverse conditions, preventive measures include altered training techniques and medications.

Some take advantage of the refractory period by precipitating an attack by ""warming up,"" and then timing competition such that it occurs during the refractory period.  Step-wise training works in a similar fashion.  Warm up occurs in stages of increasing intensity, using the refractory period generated by each stage to reach a full workload.

Medication
There is no evidence supporting different treatment for EIB in asthmatic athletes and nonathletes. The most common medication used is a beta agonist taken about 20 minutes before exercise. Some physicians prescribe inhaled anti-inflammatory mists such as corticosteroids or leukotriene antagonists, and mast cell stabilizers have also proven effective.

In May 2013, the American Thoracic Society issued the first treatment guidelines for EIB, recommending use of ""a short-acting β2-agonist before exercise in all patients with EIB. For patients who continue to have symptoms of EIB despite the administration of a short-acting β2-agonist before exercise, strong recommendations were made for a daily inhaled corticosteroid, a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist, or a mast cell stabilizing agent before exercise.""

There is conflicting information about the value of theophylline and other methylxanthines as prophylaxis against Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

Research
A crossover study compared oral montelukast with inhaled salmeterol, both given two hours before exercise, showing that the drugs had similar benefit.

A meta-analysis of preliminary research indicated that vitamin C may be useful to relieve respiratory symptoms such as cough during exercise. 

Prognosis
As evidenced by many professional athletes who have overcome EIB using some combination of accepted treatments, the prognosis is usually very good. Olympic swimmers Simon Yates, distance runner Paula Radcliffe and cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen. Research by sports scientist John Dickinson found that 70 percent of UK-based members of the British swimming team had some form of asthma, as did a third of  cyclists, compared to a national asthma rate of eight to ten percent, whilst a study by the United States Olympic Committee in 2000 found that half of cross-country skiers had EIB."
Heliox,"Heliox is a breathing gas mixture of helium (He) and oxygen (O2). It is used as a medical treatment for patients with difficulty breathing because this mixture generates less resistance than atmospheric air when passing through the airways of the lungs, and thus requires less effort by a patient to breathe in and out of the lungs. It is also used as a breathing gas diluent for deep ambient pressure diving as it is not narcotic at high pressure, and for its low work of breathing.

Heliox has been used medically since the 1930s, and although the medical community adopted it initially to alleviate symptoms of upper airway obstruction, its range of medical uses has since expanded greatly, mostly because of the low density of the gas. Heliox is also used in technical dives.

 Medical uses 
In medicine heliox may refer to a mixture of 21% O2 (the same as air) and 79% He, although other combinations are available (70/30 and 60/40).

Heliox generates less airway resistance than air and thereby requires less mechanical energy to ventilate the lungs. ""Work of breathing"" (WOB) is reduced by two mechanisms:
# increased tendency to laminar flow;
# reduced resistance in turbulent flow due to lower density.
Heliox 20/80 diffuses 1.8 times faster than oxygen, and the flow of heliox 20/80 from an oxygen flowmeter is 1.8 times the normal flow for oxygen.

Heliox has a similar STP). Flow of gas through the airway comprises laminar flow, transitional flow and turbulent flow. The tendency for each type of flow is described by the Reynolds number. Heliox's low density produces a lower Reynolds number and hence higher probability of laminar flow for any given airway. Laminar flow tends to generate less resistance than turbulent flow.

In the small airways where flow is laminar, resistance is proportional to gas viscosity and is not related to density and so heliox has little effect. The Hagen–Poiseuille equation describes laminar resistance. In the large airways where flow is turbulent, resistance is proportional to density, so heliox has a significant effect.

There is also some use of heliox in conditions of the medium airways (croup, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). A recent trial has suggested that lower fractions of helium (below 40%) thus allowing a higher fraction of oxygen might also have the same beneficial effect on upper airway obstruction.

Patients with these conditions may develop a range of symptoms including exhaustion, which can lead to respiratory failure and require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Heliox may reduce all these effects, making it easier for the patient to breathe. Heliox has also found utility in the weaning of patients off mechanical ventilation, and in the nebulization of inhalable drugs, particularly for the elderly. Research has also indicated advantages in using helium–oxygen mixtures in delivery of anaesthesia.

 History 
Heliox has been used medically since the early 1930s. It was the mainstay of treatment in acute asthma before the advent of bronchodilators. Currently, heliox is mainly used in conditions of large airway narrowing (upper airway obstruction from tumors or foreign bodies and vocal cord dysfunction).

 Usage in diving 


Helium diluted breathing gases are used to eliminate or reduce the effects of COMEX specializing in engineering and deep diving operations. Owing to the expense of helium, heliox is most likely to be used in deep technical divers, particularly those using rebreathers, which conserve the breathing gas at depth much better than open circuit scuba.

The proportion of oxygen in a diving mix depends on the maximum depth of the dive plan, but it is often hypoxic and may be less than 10%. Each mix is custom made using gas blending techniques, which often involve the use of booster pumps to achieve typical diving cylinder pressures of  from lower pressure banks of oxygen and helium cylinders.

Because voice formants are raised, making divers' speech very high-pitched and hard to understand to people not used to it. Surface personnel often employ a piece of communications equipment called a ""helium de-scrambler"", which electronically lowers the pitch of the diver's voice as it is relayed through the communications gear, making it easier to understand.

Trimix is a less expensive alternative to heliox for deep diving, which uses only enough helium to limit narcosis and gas density to tolerable levels for the planned depth. Trimix is often used in technical diving, and is also sometimes used in professional diving.

In 2015, the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit showed that decompression from bounce dives using trimix is not more efficient  than dives on heliox."
Inhaler,"An inhaler (also known as a puffer, pump or allergy spray) is a medical device used for delivering medicines into the lungs through the work of a person's breathing. This allows medicines to be delivered to and absorbed in the lungs, which provides the ability for targeted medical treatment to this specific region of the body, as well as a reduction in the side effects of oral medications. There are a wide variety of inhalers, and they are commonly used to treat numerous medical conditions with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) being among the most notable.

Some of the common types of inhalers include metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, soft mist inhalers, and nebulizers. Each device has advantages and disadvantages and can be selected based on individually specific patient needs, as well as age, pathological conditions, coordination, and lung function. Proper education on inhaler use is important to ensure that inhaled medication creates its proper effects in the lungs.

Medical uses
Inhalers are designed to deliver medication directly to the lungs through a person's own breathing. This may benefit a patient by providing medicines directly to areas of disease, allowing medication to take a greater effect on its intended target, and limit side effects of medications when administered locally. Inhalers are used in a variety of different medical conditions with diseases of the lungs and respiratory system being among the most common. Individuals with these diseases/conditions need medications designed to decrease airway inflammation and obstruction to allow for easier and comfortable breathing. Antibiotic medications have even been developed for inhalers to allow for direct delivery to areas of infection within the lungs. Two of the most common conditions that warrant inhaler therapy are asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Asthma

inflammatory processes in the lungs. Inhaled medications are used to calm down the inflammation present in the lungs and allow for relief of the airway obstruction. Common inhaled medications used for treatment of asthma are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used, but with caution since they may cause immunological hypersensitivity to NSAIDs, resulting in respiratory-related symptoms such as bronchospasms, acute asthma exacerbation, and severe asthma morbidity.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

COPD is an obstructive lung disease due to long-term damage to the airways of the lungs. The long-term damage leads to the inability of the airways to open properly, causing ipratroprium, salmeterol, and corticosteroids.

Types
Meter-dosed inhaler (MDI)
The most common type of inhaler is the pressurized aerosol form through the actuator and into a patient's lungs.  These devices require significant coordination as a person must discharge the medication at or near the same time that they inhale in order for the medication to be effective.
alt|thumb|Different types of Dry-powder inhaler|dry powder inhalers

Dry powder inhaler (DPI)
Dry powder inhalers release a metered or device-measured dose of powdered medication that is inhaled through a DPI device. This device usually contains a chamber in which the powdered medication is deposited prior to each dosage. The powder can then be inhaled with a quick breath.  This allows for medication to be delivered to the lungs without the need for use of propellant/suspension.

Soft mist inhaler (SMI)
thumb|Nebulizer with face mask
Soft mist inhalers release a light mist containing medication without the need for a propellant/suspension. Upon pressing a button, the inhaler creates a mist of medication, allowing for inhalation into the lungs. SMIs suspend inhaled medications for roughly 1.2 seconds, which is longer than the average MDI inhaler suspension time period.  This requires less coordination when using and may be helpful for young patients or patients that find the MDI inhalers difficult to use.

Nebulizer
Nebulizers are designed to deliver medications over an extended period of time over multiple breaths through a mouthpiece or face mask.  They generate a continuous mist with aerosolized medication, allowing a patient to breathe normally and receive medications.  They are commonly used in infants and toddlers requiring inhaled medications or in patients in the hospital who require inhaled medications.

Smart inhaler
The smart-inhaler is an inhaler that will automatically update an app with information that includes the time of day, air quality, and how many times it has been used through sensor technology on the device. The first smart-inhaler was approved in 2019 by the FDA, its purpose is to track patient use of the device and some other circumstantial factors that could affect the effectiveness of the dosage. This information is sent via Bluetooth to a mobile device app, and is later shared with their physician to determine what kind of things can trigger issues with asthma and other problems. This technology presents a great way to cut down on medical costs associated with asthma and also help patients better manage their condition with fewer emergencies.

The Teva ProAir Digihaler was the first FDA approved smart inhaler. It shows how effective the device is at aiding patients in using the proper dose amount for their asthma. In a study published by the European Respiratory Journal, the ProAir Digihaler accurately identified when patients were using their inhalers and whether they were effectively administering the dose in a 370 patient trial with the device. This study further gives an overview on the technology regarding applications and devices that help aid in the tracking and medication management for asthma and other lung conditions. Another study showed that smart inhalers accurately recorded all doses administered by patients with their technology, which signifies their importance in providing accurate dosage information to patients and their physicians.

Propellants
In 2009, the FDA banned the use of inhalers that use propellants. In their place, inhalers now use hydrofluoroalkane (HFA). HFA is not environmentally inert as it is a greenhouse gas but it does not affect the ozone layer. While some people with asthma and advocacy groups contend that HFA inhalers are not as effective, published clinical studies indicate CFC and HFA inhalers are equally effective in controlling asthma.

While the impact of CFCs from inhalers on the ozone layer had been minuscule (dwarfed by industrial processes using CFCs), the FDA in its interpretation of the Montreal Protocol mandated the switch in propellants. Patients expressed concern about the high price of the HFA inhalers as there were initially no generic versions, whereas generic CFC inhalers had been available.

Proper use

It is important to use proper technique when administering inhalers to self or others. Improper use of inhalers is very common, can lead to distribution of the medicine into the mouth or throat where it cannot create its desired effect and may cause harm. Education on the correct use of inhalers for delivery of medications is a commonly cited topic in medical studies and a great deal of thought has been put into how best to help people learn to use their inhalers effectively. Below is a description of proper inhaler technique for each different type of inhaler as well as a helpful video explaining what the text states.

thumb|Using an inhaler

Meter-dosed inhalers

1. The mouthpiece is removed and the inhaler is shaken for 5–10 seconds

2. The inhaler is gripped with mouthpiece on the bottom and canister on top.  A finger is placed on the canister to allow for delivery of medicine.

3. Once complete exhalation is done, mouth is placed over mouthpiece.

4. As inhalation begins, the canister is pressed down to releases the medicine into the lungs.

5. Slow deep breathing is continued and breath is held for 5–10 seconds, keeping the medicine in the lungs and preventing escape of aerosolized form of the medicine.

6. Complete exhalation is done again. If multiple puffs of the medicine have to be taken, steps 1–5 are repeated after waiting for 15–30 seconds.

7. Mouthpiece is replaced.

With spacer

Spacer is placed at the mouthpiece of a meter-dosed inhaler while keeping mouth at the end of the spacer. Deep breathing is done to be ready for the delivery of the medicine to the lungs, and then the canister is pressed down.  This minimizes need for coordination of breathing with inhaler activation.

Dry powder inhalers
1. Inhaler medication chamber is prepared (this will be different based on the type of inhaler but will involve preparing and opening the chamber with the medication)

2. The inhaler is held with the chamber pointing towards the patient and complete exhalation is done with their head turned away from the inhaler.

3. Mouth is placed over the chamber and a quick, deep breath is taken allowing medication to dispense in the lungs.

4. Breath is held for 5–10 seconds and then slow exhalation is done.

5. After waiting for a few minutes, steps 1-4 are repeated if another dose is needed.

Soft mist inhalers

1. The inhaler is primed by loading the cartridge and discharging the inhaler until a fine mist is visible (more explanation in the video).

2. Once complete exhalation is done, mouth is placed around the mouthpiece while leaving space for the small holes on the side of the mouthpiece.

3. Slow inhalation is done while simultaneously pressing the button to release the medication.

4. Breath is held for 5–10 seconds.

5. Slow exhalation is done and steps 1-4 are repeated if another dose of medication is required after waiting for a few minutes.

If inhaler is used everyday, the inhaler usually has to be primed the first time using a new cartridge, but it may need to be primed again if it has not been used in multiple days.

After use

If using inhaled corticosteroids, rinse mouth out directly after use of inhaler. This helps to prevent infection.

Nebulizer

1. Mouth is placed over mouthpiece or face mask is placed over nose and mouth

2. The nebulizer machine is turned on.

3. Normal breathing is done for 10-20 min (or time allotted for treatment).

4.  Machine is turned off and face mask/mouthpiece remove is removed.

Price and availability

In the United States, pharmaceutical manufacturers use legal and regulatory strategies to keep inhaler prices artificially high. There has been little innovation in inhaler technology for decades  the most recent drug to be approved by the FDA for treating asthma or COPD via a novel target of action was Ipratropium bromide in 1986. Since then, manufacturers have used small changes to drug delivery mechanisms, or have switched active ingredients from one inhaler device to another (a strategy known as a ""device hop"") to keep patents active. This has the effect of limiting competition, keeping inhalers expensive. Because of high prices, patients sometimes skip doses or give up using their inhalers.

History
thumb|upright|Penetro brand inhaler from mid 20th century Mexico, part of the permanent collection of the Museo del Objeto del Objeto
thumb|upright|Inhaler designed by John Mudge in 1778
The idea of directly delivering medication into the lungs was based on ancient traditional cures that involved the use of aromatic and medicinal vapors. These did not involve any special devices beyond the apparatus used for burning or heating to produce fumes. Early inhalation devices included one devised by John Mudge in 1778. It had a pewter mug with a hole allowing attachment of a flexible tube. Mudge used it for the treatment of coughs using opium. These devices evolved with modifications by Wolfe, Mackenzie (1872) and better mouth attachments such as by Beigel in 1866. Many of these early inhalers needed heat to vaporize the active chemical ingredient. The benefits of forced expiration and inspiration to treat asthma were noted by J. S. Monell in 1865. Chemicals used in inhalers included ammonia, chlorine, iodine, tar, balsams, turpentine camphor and numerous others in combinations. Julius Mount Bleyer used a variation in 1890 in New York.

thumb|left|upright|Mouthpiece for an inhaler designed by Dr Beigel (1867)
In 1968, Robert Wexler of wick of milliliters of methoxyflurane.

Because of the simplicity of the Analgizer and the pharmacological characteristics of methoxyflurane, it was easy for patients to self-administer the drug and rapidly achieve a level of conscious analgesia which could be maintained and adjusted as necessary over a period of time lasting from a few minutes to several hours. The 15&nbsp;milliliter supply of methoxyflurane would typically last for two to three hours, during which time the user would often be partly amnesic to the sense of pain; the device could be refilled if necessary.

The Analgizer was found to be safe, effective, and simple to administer in obstetric patients during childbirth, as well as for patients with bone fractures and joint dislocations, and for dressing changes on burn patients. When used for labor analgesia, the Analgizer allows labor to progress normally and with no apparent adverse effect on Apgar scores. All vital signs remain normal in obstetric patients, newborns, and injured patients. The Analgizer was widely utilized for analgesia and sedation until the early 1970s, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The Analgizer inhaler was withdrawn in 1974, but use of methoxyflurane as a sedative and analgesic continues in Australia and New Zealand in the form of the Penthrox inhaler."

Acute severe asthma, also known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of respiratory muscles, fast and/or labored breathing, and extreme wheezing. It is a life-threatening episode of airway obstruction and is considered a medical emergency. Complications include cardiac and/or respiratory arrest. The increasing prevalence of atopy and asthma remains unexplained but may be due to infection with respiratory viruses.

Signs and symptoms
An exacerbation (attack) of asthma is experienced as a worsening of asthma symptoms with breathlessness and cough (often worse at night). In acute severe asthma, breathlessness may be so severe that it is impossible to speak more than a few words (inability to complete sentences).

On examination, the respiratory rate may be elevated (more than 25 breaths per minute), and the heart rate may be rapid (110 beats per minute or faster). Reduced oxygen saturation levels (but above 92%) are often encountered. Examination of the lungs with a stethoscope may reveal reduced air entry and/or widespread wheeze. The peak expiratory flow can be measured at the bedside; in acute severe asthma, the flow is less than 50% of a person's normal or predicted flow.

Very severe acute asthma (termed ""near-fatal"" as there is an immediate risk to life) is characterised by a peak flow of less than 33% predicted, oxygen saturations below 92% or abnormal lowering of the blood pressure may be observed.

Severe asthma attack can cause symptoms such as:
* Shortness of breath
* Inability to speak in full sentences
* Feeling breathless even when lying down
* Chest feels tight
* Bluish tint to the lips
* Hunched shoulders, and strained muscles in stomach and neck
* Feeling the need to sit or stand up to breathe more easily

 Cause 
The cause for acute severe asthma attacks is still unknown and experts are also unsure of why it developed and why it does not respond to typical asthma treatments.
* Not seeing a doctor regularly, therefore asthma is not under good control
* Coming in contact with asthma triggers
* Allergies or severe allergic reactions
* Not using the peak flow meter and not taking asthma medication as directed by a primary care physician (PCP) correctly
* Not following an asthma action plan correctly
* Respiratory infections
* Severe stress
* Cold weather
* Air pollution
* Exposure to chemicals and other irritants
* Smoking

 Mechanism 
Inflammation in asthma is characterized by an influx of eosinophils during the early-phase reaction and a mixed cellular infiltrate composed of eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, and neutrophils during the late-phase (or chronic) reaction. The simple explanation for allergic inflammation in asthma begins with the development of a predominantly helper T2 lymphocyte–driven, as opposed to helper T1 lymphocyte–driven, immune milieu, perhaps caused by certain types of immune stimulation early in life. This is followed by allergen exposure in a genetically susceptible individual.

Specific allergen exposure (e.g., Th2 helper T cells leads to mucosal atopic individuals with asthma, in contrast to atopic persons without asthma, have a defect in mucosal integrity that makes them susceptible to penetration of allergens into the mucosa.

Subsequent specific allergen exposure leads to cross-bridging of IgE molecules and activation of mast cells, with elaboration and release of a vast array of mediators. These mediators include low levels of oxygen in the blood.

Diagnosis
Severe acute asthma can be diagnosed by a primary care physician (PCP). A PCP will ask questions in regards to symptoms and breathing; they will also ask if fatigue or wheezing has been experienced when breathing in or out; and also test using a peak expiratory flow and an oxygen saturation.

Status asthmaticus can be misdiagnosed when wheezing occurs from an acute cause other than asthma. Some of these alternative causes of wheezing are discussed below.

 Extrinsic compression 
Airways can be compressed from vascular structures, such as vascular rings, lymphadenopathy, or tumors.

 Congestive heart failure 
Airway edema may cause wheezing in CHF. In addition, vascular compression may compress the airways during systole with cardiac ejection, resulting in a pulsatile wheeze that corresponds to the heart rate. This is sometimes erroneously referred to as cardiac asthma.

 Differential diagnoses 
* Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
* Aspiration syndromes
* Bronchiectasis
* Bronchiolitis
* Bronchiolitis obliterans
* Chronic bronchitis
* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
* Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg–Strauss syndrome)
* Croup
* Cystic fibrosis
* Emphysema
* Foreign bodies of the airway
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease
* Heart failure
* Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
* Inhalation injury
* Pulmonary artery sling
* Vocal cord dysfunction

Treatment
Interventions include intravenous (IV) medications (e.g. magnesium sulfate), aerosolized medications to dilate the airways (bronchodilation) (e.g., albuterol or ipratropium bromide/salbutamol), and positive-pressure therapy, including mechanical ventilation. Multiple therapies may be used simultaneously to rapidly reverse the effects of status asthmaticus and reduce permanent damage of the airways. Intravenous corticosteroids and methylxanthines are often given. If the person with a severe asthma exacerbation is on a mechanical ventilator, certain sedating medications such as ketamine or propofol, have bronchodilating properties. According to a new randomized control trial ketamine and aminophylline are also effective in children with acute asthma who responds poorly to standard therapy.

 Recent research 
A recent study proposed that the interaction between host airway epithelial cells and respiratory viruses is another aspect of innate immunity that is also a critical determination of asthma. It was also proposed that a rationale for how antiviral performance at the epithelial cell level might be improved to prevent acute infectious illness and chronic inflammatory disease caused by respiratory viruses.

Another study aimed to show that experimental IFN-driven up-regulation of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) on conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in the lungs. The study found that a Novell PMN-cDc interaction in the lung is necessary for a viral infection to induce atopic disease.

Epidemiology
Status asthmaticus is slightly more common in males and is more common among people of African and Hispanic origin. The gene locus glutathione dependent S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNOR) has been suggested as one possible correlation to development of status asthmaticus."

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also called NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD) or historically aspirin-induced asthma and Samter's Triad, is a chronic respiratory disease defined by the simultaneous presence of three factors: chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and intolerance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In general, the nasal polyps are more recalcitrant and the asthma more severe than that of aspirin-tolerant patients. Reduction or loss of the ability to smell (hyposmia, anosmia) is extremely common, occurring in greater than 90% of AERD patients. AERD most commonly begins in early- to mid-adulthood and has no known cure. While NSAID intolerance is a defining feature of AERD, avoidance of NSAIDs does not prevent the onset, development or perennial nature of the disease.

The cause of the disease is a dysregulation of the innate immune cells, though the initial cause of this dysregulation is currently unknown. This dysregulation leads to an imbalance of immune related molecules, including an overproduction of inflammatory compounds such as leukotriene E4 and an underproduction of anti-inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandin E2. This imbalance, among other factors, leads to chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract.

A history of respiratory reactions to aspirin or others NSAIDs is sufficient to diagnose AERD in a patient that has both asthma and nasal polyps. However, diagnosis can be challenging during disease onset, as symptoms do not usually begin all at once. As symptoms appear, AERD may be misdiagnosed as simple allergic or triad of symptoms are present that the diagnosis of AERD can be made.

As there is no cure, treatment of AERD revolves around managing the symptoms of the disease. Corticosteroids, surgery, diet modifications and monoclonal antibody-based drugs are all commonly used, among other treatment options. Paradoxically, daily aspirin therapy after an initial desensitization can also help manage symptoms.

Reactions to aspirin and other NSAIDs range in severity but almost always have a respiratory component; severe reactions can be life threatening. The symptoms of NSAID-induced reactions are hypersensitivity reactions rather than NSAID hypersensitivity.

 Signs and symptoms 
AERD affects an estimated 0.3–0.9% of the general population in the US, including around 7% of all asthmatics, about 14% of adults with severe asthma, and ~5-10% of patients with adult onset asthma. AERD is uncommon among children, with around 6% of patients, predominantly female, reporting disease onset during childhood. It is more prevalent among women by up to a 2:1 margin, usually begins in the patient's twenties to forties, with mean age of onset around 35. AERD patients may not have any allergies, though allergies are significantly more common in AERD patients than the general population. While AERD has been found to affect essentially all ethnicities, it is less common in parts of Asia where nasal polyps caused by type 2 inflammation are relatively more rare.

While disease progression varies, most commonly the first symptom is rhinitis (inflammation or irritation of the nasal mucosa), which may manifest as sneezing, runny nose, or congestion. The disorder typically progresses to asthma, then nasal polyposis, with aspirin sensitivity coming last. Hyposmia or anosmia—reduction or loss of the ability to smell—are reported in more than 90% of patients, as inflammation within the nose and sinuses likely reaches the olfactory receptors.

Reactions to NSAIDs range in severity and expression. Onset is usually relatively rapid, with a mean time of around one hour after ingestion, though reactions as late as three hours have been reported. Respiratory reactions are essentially universal, with urticaria (hives), flushing, angioedema and hypotension. Gastrointestinal reactions have also been reported in a subset of patients, and may be difficult to treat. Factors that affect reaction severity include NSAID dosage, underlying asthma control, leukotriene modifier usage and the state of the patient's nasal polyps.

In addition to aspirin, patients also react to other NSAIDs such as COX-1) enzyme, although paracetamol (acetaminophen) in low doses is generally considered safe. Selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs that do not block COX-1, such as the celecoxib and rofecoxib, also are regarded as safe. Nonetheless, recent studies do find that these types of drugs, e.g. acetaminophen and celecoxib, may trigger adverse reactions in these patients; caution is recommended in using any COX inhibitors. In addition to aspirin and NSAIDs, consumption of even small amounts of alcohol also produces uncomfortable respiratory reactions in many patients.

 Causes and Pathophysiology 
The reason for onset of AERD is currently unknown. Allergic reaction to the superantigen of Staphylococcus aureus, chronic viral infection and autoimmune mechanisms have been theorized, among others, though there is not sufficient evidence to support any specific theory. No strong genetic predisposition to or basis of AERD has been found, and familial AERD is rare. In addition, there is no relationship between past use of NSAIDs and onset of AERD

AERD is generally thought to have two major components contributing to disease pathogenesis: abnormalities in the arachidonic acid metabolic cascade and dysregulation of various innate immune cells. These two components feed into each other in a highly complex negative cycle of increasing inflammation and dysregulation that is still under active research.

 Arachidonic acid cascade dysregulation 
AERD is associated with an aberrant arachidonic acid metabolism that leads to changes in levels of two major classes of eicosanoids, specifically certain cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) and prostaglandins. Notably, reduced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) decreases inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), causing increased conversion of arachidonic acid into leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is converted into leukotriene C (LTC), which itself is converted into leukotriene D (LTD) and leukotriene E (LTE), both powerful bronchoconstrictors. In contrast to PGE2, AERD patients show significantly higher levels of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), which exerts pro-inflammatory effects via its recruitment of eosinophils and type 2 helper T cells (TH2) cells in addition to its direct bronchoconstrictive action.

The exact mechanism by which aspirin and other COX-1 inhibitors lead to acute respiratory reactions is still under investigation. AERD patients exhibit a seemingly paradoxical response to COX-1 inhibition, as it leads to greatly increased PGD2 and LTE levels, instead of the expected decrease in PGD2 and relative lack of change in LTE. However, given that COX-1 catalyzes the formation of PGE2, a leading explanation is that patients have an increased dependence on PGE2 and its corresponding receptor (EP2) to prevent inflammatory mediator release from mast cells. When COX-1 is inhibited, the decreased PGE2 production leads to mast cell degranulation and release of LTC and PGD2, which leads to respiratory symptom exacerbation.

Patients with AERD also show increased expression of leukotriene C synthase (LTCS), which converts LTA4 into LTC. Platelets, which express  LTCS and generate LTC when attached to 5-LO-expressing leukocytes (including eosinophils), are also implicated in disease pathogenesis as well as acute aspirin-induced exacerbations. Additionally, after aspirin or other NSAID exposure, AERD patients generally become desensitized and tolerate a second exposure for around one week, which lines up with the half life of circulating platelets.

Additional downstream products of arachidonic acid such as 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO) produced 15-HETE and 15-Oxo-ETE are significantly elevated in nasal polyps from AERD patients while other products like anti-inflammatory lipoxins are reduced. It's possible that increased 15-LO activity and preferential conversion of arachidonic acid into 15-Oxo-ETE and eoxins over lipoxins contributes to inflammation in AERD.

 Innate immune cells 
Various innate immune cells also appear to play important roles in AERD pathogenesis. Eosinophils, mast cells, basophils and type 2 innate lymphoid (ILC2) cells have all been found at increased levels in the nasal polyps of AERD patients and appear to be part of the negative cycle of inflammation in AERD.

altA diagram of some of the interactions between immune cells and their products, as relevant to AERD disease pathophysiology|thumb|400x400px|An overview of some of the immune cells and molecules involved in the negative cycle of disease in AERD
ILC2 cells are activated by CysLTs and PGD2 in addition to a class of cytokines called alarmins that are released by epithelial cells, including IL-25, IL-33 and IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. These cytokines lead to increased eosinophil recruitment, excessive mucus production via goblet cells, and promotion of TH2 and immunoglobulin E responses. These responses cause the epithelial cells to release more cytokines and inflammatory molecules, creating a feed-forward negative cycle of increasing inflammation.

Eosinophils are also activated by ILC2-released IL-5 and epithelial-cell released IL-33, causing them to release more CysLTs and PGD2, which in turn further active ILC2. Likewise, mast cells are also activated by epithelial-cell released IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, leading to further CysLT and PGD2 production.

Basophils, which are degranulated in AERD nasal polyps, also appear to be important sources of IL-4 and IL-13. In addition to activating immune cells, IL-4 and IL-13 have been shown to significantly increase 15-LO activity, further playing into the cycle of dysregulation and disease.

 Diagnosis 
Diagnosis of AERD can be difficult, as symptoms develop over time and can often be attributed to allergies, common asthma, and/or nonallergic rhinitis. AERD is generally diagnosed based on a patient's medical history, however an oral aspirin challenge at a specialized facility is considered the most definitive method of diagnosis.

Patients are considered candidates for an AERD diagnosis if they meet the following three points:

* History of adverse reactions to aspirin or other NSAIDs
* Reduced ability to smell (hyposmia or anosmia)
* History of rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps

Further, if a patient meets two or more of the following criteria, then an AERD diagnosis is strongly considered:

* Moderate or severe asthma
* Asthma with an intractable cough
* Onset of asthma after adolescence
* A weakly atopic disposition
* 10% or greater increase in peripheral eosinophilia

High urinary leukotriene E (uLTE) concentration is also a sign of AERD, especially when noted in conjunction with the criteria listed above due. High uLTE concentration alone cannot be used to diagnose AERD, however it may be possible to rule out AERD in patients without high uLTE due to its strong negative predictive value. Urinary LTE concentration is generally around 3 to 5 times higher in patients with AERD that it is in those with aspirin-tolerant asthma, and increases 2 to 30 fold during an aspirin challenge test.

 Management 

 Medication 

Since nasal polyps have been identified as an important source of inflammatory compounds in AERD, much effort goes into the prevention of polyp growth and control of sinus symptoms in general. There is evidence supporting four different long-term pharmacological treatments to this end: intra-nasal corticosteroids, aspirin desensitization and therapy, a range of biologic medicines, and antileukotrienes. Each treatment has benefits and drawbacks, so no one option can be recommended for all patients. Asthma symptoms, if not controlled via biologics or other means, are managed with standard asthma treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists.

Despite optimal medical management, many patients continue to require oral steroid medications to alleviate asthma and chronic nasal congestion.

 Intra-nasal corticosteroids 
Common corticosteroids such as exhalation delivery systems. Overall effectiveness is low-to-moderate, but wide availability and low cost make this a widely used treatment option. Stent, spray and exhalation delivery systems are generally among the most beneficial depending on outcome measured, while no major differences in adverse effects have been measured between delivery methods.

 Aspirin desensitization and therapy 
Avoidance of NSAID medications will not stop the progression of the disease. However, one treatment option is desensitization to aspirin, undertaken at a clinic or hospital specializing in such treatment. Patients who are desensitized then take a maintenance dose of aspirin daily to maintain their desensitization. The recommended maintenance dose for symptom control is 650&nbsp;mg to 1300&nbsp;mg aspirin daily. While on daily aspirin, patients experience improved quality of life and reduced nasal symptoms, however, there is no improvement in smell compared to placebo and there is no reduction in the need for oral corticosteroids or rescue surgery. Once desensitized to aspirin, most patients can safely take other NSAID medications again as long the daily maintenance dose is continued.

Risk of adverse advents such as bleeding or gastrointestinal side effects is relatively high with daily aspirin therapy. Even a 81&nbsp;mg daily aspirin regimen for cardiovascular benefits has been shown to increase risk of long-term bleeding, so the significantly higher aspirin doses used for maintenance therapy are of some concern. This is borne out in studies on AERD patients—compared against standard of care and biologic medicines, aspirin therapy has a significantly higher rate of adverse outcomes.

 Biologics 
Various novel biologic monoclonal antibody medications that have come to market in recent years have been used to treat AERD including dupilumab, mepolizumab, omalizumab, and benralizumab. Among treatment options, biologics have the highest certainty and magnitude of improvement effect. However, due to the high cost and systemic nature of biologics, some patients whose symptoms are sufficiently controlled with other treatments may prefer to avoid them or not qualify under stricter prescription guidelines.

Among biologics and aspirin desensitization and therapy, dupilumab (Dupixent) was show to be the most effective across six different patient-important outcomes. Dupilumab and omalizumab have been shown to increase aspirin tolerance in AERD patients, however mepolizumab does not appear to have this effect. The mechanism through which dupilumab treats AERD and restores aspirin tolerance is not fully understood, but it is theorized that by blocking IL-4α, dupilumab increases expression of EP2, the receptor for PGE2, back to normal levels, normalizing COX function and PGE2 production. Low PGE2 production and activity appear to play a key role in AERD, as PGE2 prevents inflammatory mediator release from mast cells and inhibits 5-LO function, which decreases production of CysLTs.

 Antileukotrienes 
Leukotrienes are a family of inflammatory mediators derived from arachidonic acid that include CysLTs implicated in AERD pathophysiology. Drugs that prevent leukotriene production, such as zileuton, and that block leukotriene receptors, such as montelukast and zafirlukast, have proven to be useful in treatment of nasal polyposis. However, there may be limited additional benefit when used in conjunction with intra-nasal corticosteroids. In a large survey, AERD patients reported that zileuton was more effective at controlling their symptoms than montelukast. Despite this, zileuton remains less prescribed than montelukast, likely due to concerns around risk of liver enzyme elevation.

 Surgery 

Often functional endoscopic sinus surgery is required to remove nasal polyps, although they typically recur, particularly if aspirin desensitization is not undertaken. Approximately, 90% of patients have been shown to have recurrence of nasal polyps within five years after surgery, with 47% requiring revision surgery in the same time period. A complete endoscopic sinus surgery followed by aspirin desensitization has been shown to reduce the need for revision surgeries. Exact cause of nasal polyp formation is unknown, however, differential gene expression analysis of AERD nasal polyp epithelial cells versus AERD non polyp nasal mucosa revealed DMRT3 could be potentially involved in nasal polyp development in AERD patients. Furthermore, several genes are down-regulated, hinting at the de-differentiation phenomenon in AERD polyps.

 Diet 
 Low omega-6/high omega-3 
Given that dysregulation of the arachidonic acid cascade has been implicated in AERD pathogenesis and that production of arachidonic acid and its downstream products is influenced by the interaction and metabolism of omega-3 and omega-6 essential fatty acids, dietary interventions targeting the two essential fatty acids are under study.

A diet low in omega-6 fatty acids and high in omega-3 fatty acids—the opposite of an average modern western diet—has been shown to reduce arachidonic acid precursors and increase prostaglandin D levels and significantly improved overall symptoms. AERD specialists routinely recommend this diet as a treatment option.

 Alcohol 
The majority of those with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease experience respiratory reactions to alcohol. One study found that 83% reported such reactions. Of those who had reactions, 75% had a sinus reaction (runny nose, nasal congestion) and 51% had a lower respiratory reaction (wheezing, shortness of breath). The current theory on the cause of these reactions is that they may be related to polyphenols found in alcoholic beverages. A 2017 study found that alcohol sensitive patients reacted to catechins in red wine, but not to resveratrol. It has been suggested that steel fermented white wines and clear liquors may cause less of a reaction than other alcoholic beverages. Desensitization to aspirin has been found to reduce reactions to alcohol.

 Dietary salicylates 
Given that aspirin is a salicylate, specifically acetyl salicylic acid, research has gone into low-salicylate diets such as the Feingold diet to see if they benefit AERD patients. For example, a prospective randomized trial with 30 patients following a low-salicylate diet for six weeks demonstrated a clinically significant decrease in both subjective and objective scoring of severity of disease, but made note of the challenge for patients in following what is a fairly stringent diet. Despite these findings, experts on the disease do not believe that dietary salicylates contribute to AERD symptoms. Dietary salicylates do not significantly inhibit the COX-1 enzyme, which is the cause of AERD reactions. One confounding factor in the study that showed a benefit from avoidance of dietary salicylates is that a low salicylate diet involves eliminating wine and beer. The majority of AERD patients react to wine and beer for reasons that do not involve their salicylate content. There is also a strong placebo effect involved with any dietary intervention. In contrast to aspirin, dietary salicylates are not acetylated and therefore do not block cyclooxygenases and hence, there is no rationale why a low salicylate diet would be beneficial for AERD patients.

History
The first adverse reactions to aspirin were described in 1902 in Germany, only four years after aspirin's commercial introduction. The first published report of an aspirin-induced asthma attack was in 1911. Initial reports on the linkage between asthma, aspirin, and nasal polyposis were made by Samter and Beers in reports published in 1968, which brought full clinical characterization. The recognition Samter brought to the disease through his studies led to it being called ""Samter's triad"", although today ""aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease"" is preferred to better reflect the progressive nature of the condition even when patients abstain from NSAIDs."
Specific inhalation challenge,"The specific inhalation challenge (SIC) is a diagnosis tool to assess airway responsiveness to ""sensitizing"" substances as opposed to nonspecific stimuli such as pharmacological agents (i.e. histamine, methacholine), cold air and exercise. Subjects are exposed to a suspected occupational agent in a controlled way under close supervision in a hospital laboratory. The specific inhalation challenges has been considered as the gold standard in confirming the diagnosis of occupational asthma.

 Methods 
One of the steps of SIC is to perform a challenge with the suspected asthmagen. Then, FEV1 is subsequently measured using another device and compared to a baseline.
A positive response is usually a decrease in baseline FEV1 of 15 to 20 percent.

 Realistic method 
The realistic method was developed in the 1970s. The patient enters a sealed chamber and is exposed to the suspected agent in a controlled, non-work, test environment. The asthmagen can be water-soluble and nebulized. If the agent is non-soluble, the patient tips the agent from one tray to another in an attempt to mimic the work environment. This method has the advantage of being able to assess, albeit highly subjectively,	ocular and nasal symptoms as well as a reduction in FEV1.

There are, however, disadvantages to the method. First, SIC is currently only conducted in specialty facilities because the facilities and equipment are rare and expensive. Second, the realistic method may exposed the patient to huge concentrations of particles, resulting in unduly severe asthma attacks. Alternately, the agent can be delivered using the recently developed closed-circuit technique.

 Closed-circuit method  
This test requires the patient to breathe aerosols of the suspected agent (asthmagen) through an oro-facial mask or mouth piece. These asthmagens are aerosolized using closed-circuit chambers, and the quantities and concentrations administered being minute and extremely stable minimize the risk of exaggerated responses."

Brittle asthma is a type of trigger on a background of well controlled asthma.

Brittle asthma is one of the ""unstable"" subtypes of ""difficult asthma"", a term used to characterize the less than 5% of asthma cases that do not respond to maximal inhaled treatment, including high doses of beta-2 agonists.



Diagnosis
Types
The 2005 ''wheezing, and chest tightness. Individuals with type 1 suffer chronic attacks in spite of ongoing medical therapy, while those with type 2 experience sudden, acute and even potentially life-threatening attacks even though otherwise their asthma seems well managed.Holgate et al., 292.

When first defined by Margaret Turner-Warwick in 1977, the term brittle asthma was used specifically to describe type 1, but as studies into the phenotype were conducted the second type was also distinguished.

Treatment
In addition to any issues of treatment compliance, and maximised corticosteroids (inhaled or oral) and beta agonist,  brittle asthma treatment also involves for type 1 additional subcutaneous injections of beta2 agonist and inhalation of long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist,  whilst type 2 needs allergen avoidance and self-management approaches. Since catastrophic attacks are unpredictable in type 2, patients may display identification of the issue, such as a MedicAlert bracelet, and carry an epinephrine autoinjector.

Epidemiology
The condition is rare. 1999's ''Difficult Asthma'' estimates a prevalence of approximately 0.05% brittle asthma sufferers among the asthmatic population.Holgate et al., 293. Though found in all ages, it is most commonly found in individuals between the ages of 18 and 55; it is present in both sexes, though type 1 has been diagnosed in three times as many women as men. Hospitalization is more frequent for type 1 than type 2."
Pathophysiology of asthma,"Asthma is a common pulmonary condition defined by chronic inflammation of respiratory tubes, tightening of respiratory smooth muscle, and episodes of bronchoconstriction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 1 in 11 children and 1 in 12 adults have asthma in the United States of America. According to the World Health Organization, asthma affects 235 million people worldwide. There are two major categories of asthma: allergic and non-allergic. The focus of this article will be allergic asthma. In both cases, bronchoconstriction is prominent.

Bronchoconstriction
thumb|300px|Inflamed airways and bronchoconstriction in asthma results in airways narrowing and thus wheezing.
thumb|Obstruction of the lumen of the bronchiole by mucoid exudate, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial basement membrane thickening and severe inflammation of bronchiole.
During an asthma episode, inflamed airways react to environmental triggers such as smoke, dust, or pollen. The airways narrow and produce excess mucus, making it difficult to breathe.
In essence, asthma is the result of an immune response in the bronchial airways.

The airways of asthma patients are ""hypersensitive"" to certain triggers, also known as ''stimuli'' (see below). (It is usually classified as bronchi (large airways) contract into spasm (an ""asthma attack""). Inflammation soon follows, leading to a further narrowing of the airways and excessive mucus production, which leads to coughing and other breathing difficulties. Bronchospasm may resolve spontaneously in 1–2 hours, or in about 50% of subjects, may become part of a 'late' response, where this initial insult is followed 3–12 hours later with further bronchoconstriction and inflammation.Murray and Nadel's Textbook of Respiratory Medicine, 4th Ed. Robert J. Mason, John F. Murray, Jay A. Nadel, 2005, Elsevier pp. 334

The normal caliber of the bronchus is maintained by a balanced functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which both operate reflexively. The parasympathetic reflex loop consists of afferent nerve endings which originate under the inner lining of the bronchus. Whenever these afferent nerve endings are stimulated (for example, by dust, cold air or fumes) impulses travel to the brain-stem vagal center, then down the vagal efferent pathway to again reach the bronchial small airways. Acetylcholine is released from the efferent nerve endings. This acetylcholine results in the excessive formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in bronchial smooth muscle cells which leads to muscle shortening and this initiates bronchoconstriction.

Bronchial inflammation
thumb|Normal and Bronchial Asthma Tissues (a) Normal lung tissue does not have the characteristics of lung tissue during (b) an asthma attack, which include thickened mucosa, increased mucus-producing goblet cells, and eosinophil infiltrates. 
The mechanisms behind allergic asthma—i.e., asthma resulting from an immune response to inhaled airways are ingested by a type of cell known as TH0 cells) ""check"" and usually ignore the allergen molecules. In asthma patients, however, these cells transform into a different type of cell (TH2), for reasons that are not well understood. A possible reason could be the release of Interleukin-4 by Mast cells that induce differentiation of naive helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells.

The resultant TH2 cells activate an important arm of the immune system, known as the humoral immune system. The humoral immune system produces antibodies against the inhaled allergen. Later, when a patient inhales the same allergen, these antibodies ""recognize"" it and activate a humoral response. Inflammation results: chemicals are produced that cause the wall of the airway to thicken, cells which produce scarring to proliferate and contribute to further 'airway remodeling', causes mucus producing cells to grow larger and produce more and thicker mucus, and the cell-mediated arm of the immune system is activated. Inflamed airways are more hyper-reactive, and will be more prone to bronchospasm.

The ""hygiene hypothesis"" postulates that in early life, an imbalance in the regulation of these TH cell types leads to a long-term domination of the cells involved in allergic responses over those involved in fighting infection. The suggestion is that for a child being exposed to microbes early in life, taking fewer antibiotics, living in a large family, and growing up in the country stimulate the TH1 response and reduce the odds of developing asthma.

Asthma is associated with a procoagulant state in the bronchoalveolar space.

*Indoor air pollution from volatile organic compounds, including perfumes and perfumed products. Examples include soap, dishwashing liquid, laundry detergent, fabric softener, paper tissues, paper towels, toilet paper, shampoo, hair spray, hair gel, cosmetics, facial cream, sun cream, deodorant, cologne, shaving cream, aftershave lotion, air freshener and candles, and products such as oil-based paint.
*β-adrenergic antagonists (beta blockers), ibuprofen, and penicillin.
*Food allergies such as eggs. However, asthma is rarely the only symptom, and not all people with food or other allergies have asthma 
*Sulfite sensitivity Asthma can occur in reaction to ingestion or inhalation of sulfites, which are added to foods and wine as preservatives.
* Salicylate sensitivity Salicylates can trigger asthma in sensitive individuals. Salicylates occur naturally in many healthy foods. Aspirin is also a salicylate.
*Use of air pollution, such as urban areas.
*Various industrial compounds (e.g. chlorinated swimming pools generate monochloramine (NH2Cl), dichloramine (NHCl2) and trichloramine (NCl3)—in the air around them, which are known to induce asthma.
*Early childhood viral colds and other respiratory infections even though their normal stimuli might be from another category (e.g. pollen) and absent at the time of infection. In many cases, significant asthma may not even occur until the respiratory infection is in its waning stage, and the person is seemingly improving. In children, the most common triggers are viral illnesses such as those that cause the common cold.
*Exercise or intense use of respiratory system—the effects of which differ somewhat from those of the other triggers, since they are brief. They are thought to be primarily in response to the exposure of the airway epithelium to cold, dry air.
*Hormonal changes in adolescent girls and adult women associated with their menstrual cycle can lead to a worsening of asthma. Some women also experience a worsening of their asthma during pregnancy whereas others find no significant changes, and in other women their asthma improves during their pregnancy.
*Psychological stress. There is growing evidence that psychological stress is a trigger. It can modulate the immune system, causing an increased inflammatory response to allergens and pollutants.
*Cold weather can make it harder for patients to breathe.
 Whether high altitude helps or worsens asthma is debatable and may vary from person to person.
* Obesity and the systemic inflammation of obesity has been shown to worsen lung function and increase the risk of developing asthma exacerbations.

Pathogenesis
The fundamental problem in asthma appears to be immunological: young children in the early stages of asthma show signs of excessive inflammation in their airways. Epidemiological findings give clues as to the pathogenesis: the incidence of asthma seems to be increasing worldwide, and asthma is now very much more common in affluent countries.

In 1968 Andor Szentivanyi first described ''The Beta Adrenergic Theory of Asthma''; in which blockage of the Beta-2 receptors of pulmonary smooth muscle cells causes asthma.<!--

Asthma and sleep apnea
It is recognized with increasing frequency that patients who have both CPAP is not effective in patients with nocturnal asthma only.

Asthma and gastro-esophageal reflux disease
If gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is present, the patient may have repetitive episodes of acid aspiration. GERD may be common in difficult-to-control asthma, but according to one study, treating it does not seem to affect the asthma.
When there is a clinical suspicion for GERD as the cause of the asthma, an Esophageal pH Monitoring is required to confirm the diagnosis and establish the relationship between GERD and asthma.

 Asthma and exposure to air pollution during pregnancy 
Asthma affects four to eight out of a hundred pregnant women. This is due to the fact that during pregnancy, there is an immunological shift due to hormonal fluctuations. In some cases, there is an increase in Estrogen levels which in turn reduce the activity of natural killer cells, Th1 cell production of inflammatory cytokines, and production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. As we have seen, these play an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma.

Researchers found a link between the preterm birth and exposure to air pollution in asthmatic pregnant women. Results suggested that women with asthma have a higher risk of preterm birth. Researchers suggested that asthmatic episodes in pregnant women were associated with ongoing exposure to nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide - types of air pollutants.

Researchers also studied when women were most susceptible to develop asthma. Data indicated that women were at a higher risk of developing asthma when exposed to pollutants before conception and during pregnancy. In particular, ""an increase of 30 parts per billion (ppb) in nitrogen oxide exposure in the three months prior to pregnancy increased preterm birth risk by nearly 30 percent for women with asthma, compared to 8 percent for women without asthma.""

In other studies, Scientists have found a link between asthma in children and prenatal exposure to air pollution. Results from a study that consisted of 65, 000 Canadian children suggested that children of mothers who lived near highways during pregnancy had a 25% increased risk of developing asthma before the age of five when compared with children of mothers who did not live near highways. Highways are a major source of traffic-related air pollution such that there is an accumulation of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide (emitted from vehicles) in the vicinity of highways.

In another study, researchers collected data from 6,000 children attending public schools in California. The results suggested that a high exposure to prenatal air pollution was strongly correlated with increased susceptibility to asthma during childhood."
Asthmagen,"An asthmagen is a substance that can cause asthma in exposed people. Workplace asthmagens induce what is called occupational asthma. A 2016 study of occupational asthmagens in Australia identified  277 in 27 groups, including ammonia, latex, pesticides and wood dust.

Common asthmagens
Some of the more common asthmagens include: wood dusts (both hard and soft), dusts."
Bronchial thermoplasty,"Bronchial thermoplasty is a treatment for severe FDA in 2010 involving the delivery of controlled, therapeutic radiofrequency energy to the airway wall, thus heating the tissue and reducing the amount of smooth muscle present in the airway wall. This reduces the capacity of the immune system to cause bronchoconstriction through nitric oxide signalling, which is the main root cause of asthma symptoms. Bronchial thermoplasty is normally used to treat patients with severe persistent asthma who do not respond well to typical pharmacotherapy regimens.

Procedure
thumb|Animation of bronchial thermoplasty catheter use

A full course of bronchial thermoplasty treatment includes three separate bronchoscopic procedures: one for the each lower lobe of the lung and another for both upper lobes. Each outpatient procedure is performed approximately three weeks apart.

Under sedation, a catheter inside a bronchoscope—a thin, flexible tube-like instrument introduced through the patient’s nose or mouth and into their lungs—delivers thermal energy into the airways. The patient is monitored after the procedure and usually returns home the day of the procedure or early the following day. The catheter delivers a series of 10-second temperature controlled bursts of radio frequency energy which heat the lining of the lungs to 65 degrees Celsius. It is this heat that destroys some of the muscle tissue which constricts during an asthma attack, reducing the number and severity of exacerbations.

Through a standard bronchoscopy procedure, a small flexible tube is advanced into the airway, via mouth or nose, to mildly heat the airway walls. This treatment has been shown to result in acute epithelial destruction with regeneration observed in the regeneration, and it is instead replaced with connective tissue. The treatment has been shown in prospective studies to be safe and effective with duration up to five years. Bronchial thermoplasty is indicated for the treatment of severe persistent asthma in patients 18 years and older whose asthma is not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long acting beta agonists as per GINA guidelines.

Benefits
In a double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical study of bronchial thermoplasty, adults with severe asthma treated with bronchial thermoplasty had improved asthma-related quality of life out to a year compared to the control (sham-treated) patients.  Additionally, when compared to control patients, patients treated with bronchial thermoplasty also experienced the following benefits, although none reached statistical significance:
*32% reduction in asthma attacks
*84% reduction in emergency room visits for respiratory symptoms
*66% reduction in days lost from work, school, or other daily activities due to asthma symptoms
*73% reduction in hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms

In a clinical study, bronchial thermoplasty has been proven to provide long-term reduction in asthma induced breathing difficulty to at least 5 years and improve the quality of life for severe persistent asthma patients. Reduction in asthma attacks, ER visits, and hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms are maintained to at least 5 years. These benefits were observed during clinical studies where patients continued to take their standard maintenance asthma medications which included combinations of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting bronchodilators.

Risks


In the period immediately following the bronchial thermoplasty procedure, there was an expected transient increase in the frequency and worsening of respiratory-related symptoms. Bronchial thermoplasty is not appropriate for patients who:
*Are under 18 years old
*Have a pacemaker, internal defibrillator, or other implantable electronic device
*Have a known sensitivity to medications required to perform bronchoscopy, including lidocaine, atropine and benzodiazepines
*Have previously been treated with bronchial thermoplasty

Bronchial thermoplasty is irreversible; the smooth muscle tissue which is destroyed cannot be recovered.

Procedure Availability
Bronchial thermoplasty was first approved by FDA in April 2010. Bronchial thermoplasty is now being used as a treatment in many countries which include United Kingdom, India, and United States."
Reactive airway disease,"Reactive airway disease (RAD) is an informal label that physicians apply to patients with symptoms similar to those of dyspnea, and production of sputum that may or may not be caused by asthma. Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes. Physicians most commonly label patients with RAD when they are hesitant about formally diagnosing a patient with asthma, which is most prevalent in the pediatric setting. While some physicians may use ''RAD'' and ''asthma'' synonymously, there is controversy over this usage.

More generally, there is controversy over the use of RAD as a label in the healthcare setting, largely due to the ambiguous definition that the term has. Since RAD is not recognized as a real clinical diagnosis, its meaning is highly inconsistent and may cause confusion and misdiagnosis within the medical community. There are also concerns with overtreatment and undertreatment with RAD amongst physicians, since there is little formality with the label. Other problems that healthcare workers have with the use of the RAD label include its exclusion in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, which can lead to billing issues in hospitals and other health care facilities, and the creation of a fabricated sense of security when using it has a diagnosis.

RAD can be confused with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome, an asthma-like disorder that results from high exposure to vapors, fumes, and/or smoke. Unlike RAD, reactive airways dysfunction syndrome is recognized by multiple societies as a real clinical syndrome, including the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians.

Terminology
thumb|It is common to see RAD incorrectly used as a synonym for asthma.
The term ''reactive airway disease'' originally began to appear in medical literature in the 1980s in reference to asthmatic patients with hyperactive airways, which is a common feature of asthma. This feature is characterized by increased bronchoconstriction reactions in response to stimuli that should not elicit so strong of response. These stimuli can include methacholine, histamine, and distilled water. However, while this was how the term initially was introduced, ''RAD'' soon began to be used interchangeably with the term ''asthma'' itself, which has led to the current controversy over its place in medical diagnoses.

More commonly, RAD is now mostly used by physicians when they are hesitant to diagnose a patient with asthma. This is most prominent in pediatric settings for a variety of reasons. While infants tend to wheeze more often than adults, only one-third of them eventually go on to actually have asthma. Asthma and viral bronchiolitis can also be nearly identical to each other when presented in very young children, since they both consist of wheezing, coughing, and nasal congestion. In addition, typical tests used to accurately diagnose children with asthma, such as the bronchial challenge test, are not considered to be accurate for children under the age of five. This can be due to failure of very young children to cooperate. Diagnosing a child with asthma also carries a certain negative connotation, causing hesitancy from some physicians to do so. All of these factors lead physicians to label young children with RAD instead of asthma, since the disease is often only suspected and unable to be confirmed with pediatric patients.

Physicians will generally label an adult with RAD if they have no prior diagnosis or history of asthma while exhibiting symptoms of wheezing, production of sputum, and/or the use of an inhaler. Symptoms may also include, but are not limited to, coughing, shortness of breath, excess mucus in the bronchial tube, swollen mucous membrane in the bronchial tube, and/or hypersensitive bronchial tubes. In order to make a formal asthma diagnosis in adult patients, there is requirement to have documentation of either airway hyperreactivity or some sort of reversible airway obstruction. If none of these symptoms are present in an adult patients' medical history or documentation, the physician may label the patient with RAD instead of asthma in order to still indicate there is an airway issue without formal diagnosis.

Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome
While the acronyms are similar, reactive airway disease (RAD) and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) are not the same.

Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome was first identified by Stuart M. Brooks and colleagues in 1985 as an asthma-like syndrome developing after a single exposure to high levels of an irritating vapor, fume, or smoke. It can manifest in adults with exposure to high levels of chlorine, ammonia, acetic acid, or sulphur dioxide, creating symptoms like asthma. These symptoms can vary from mild to fatal and can even create long-term airway damage, depending on the amount of exposure and the concentration of chlorine. Patients that have been diagnosed with RADS will likely have methacholine airway hyperreactivity, yet other tests that also measure pulmonary functions may appear normal. Some experts classify RADS as occupational asthma. Those with exposure to highly irritating substances should receive treatment to mitigate harmful effects. Treatment for RADS is similar to treatment for other disorders that result from acute inhalation. Preexisting allergies can be a risk factor for developing RADS.

The main difference between RAD and RADS is that RADS can occur after just one exposure to the inhalants and without any prior sensitization. In addition, although the symptoms of RADS are very similar to those of asthma, they may be resolved. While some physicians argue that RADS is also not a real clinical syndrome, it is more commonly recognized in legitimate associations than RAD. These associations include the American Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians.

 Controversy over use 
thumb|First page of the 2010 ICD
There remains controversy over the use of RAD as an unofficial diagnosis. With its use not only being limited to clinical lexicon, but also transitioning to clinical literature now, more physicians are now increasingly disapproving its use in the healthcare setting.

One of the largest problems with the using RAD as a diagnostic label lies in the ambiguity of its meaning, as RAD has no true clinical definition. It is either not listed or redirects to ""asthma"" in all major medical journal or website. In addition to that, it is also not recognized in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. In addition, treatments for asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or pneumonia may not be prescribed under a label of reactive airway disease. In contrast, some physicians also fear overtreatment for RAD, as patients can be prescribed inhaled beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids, which are medications used for asthma. If an individual with RAD does not have asthma, there is no evidence these treatments are beneficial. As a result of its ambiguous place in the medical field, the symptoms used to characterize it are often inconsistent and can lead to confusion in a healthcare setting. This is a troubling issue for many physicians, as care can be made more complicated; many patients labeled with RAD do not ultimately have asthma and most RAD patients have never formally had their airway reactivity measured.

In addition to the inconsistencies of its labeling, there is also no billing designation for RAD in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or the ICD, which can lead to problems for healthcare facilities. Searches in the ICD, point to content relating to asthma. Some medical professionals argue that using RAD as a diagnosis will only complicate research on asthma in the context of clinical research and epidemiology. There is also dispute that by giving physicians the ability to label a patient with RAD, it gives them a fabricated sense of security that they have made a diagnosis, when no real recognizable diagnosis has been concluded."
Metered-dose inhaler,"thumb|Metered-dose Inhaler
A metered-dose inhaler (MDI) is a device that delivers a specific amount of medication to the lungs, in the form of a short burst of aerosolized medicine that is usually self-administered by the patient via inhalation. It is the most commonly used delivery system for treating asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and other respiratory diseases. The medication in a metered dose inhaler is most commonly a bronchodilator, corticosteroid or a combination of both for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Other medications less commonly used but also administered by MDI are mast cell stabilizers, such as cromoglicate or nedocromil.

 Description 
thumb|MDI canister and actuator components from H&T Presspart

A metered-dose inhaler consists of three major components; the canister which is produced in aluminium or stainless steel by means of deep drawing, where the formulation resides; the metering valve, which allows a metered quantity of the formulation to be dispensed with each actuation; and an actuator (or mouthpiece) which allows the patient to operate the device and directs the aerosol into the patient's lungs., The formulation itself is made up of the drug, a liquefied gas propellant and, in many cases, stabilising excipients. The actuator contains the mating discharge nozzle and generally includes a dust cap to prevent contamination.

To use the inhaler the patient presses down on the top of the canister, with their thumb supporting the lower portion of the actuator. Actuation of the device releases a single metered dose of the formulation which contains the medication either dissolved or suspended in the propellant. Breakup of the volatile propellant into droplets, followed by rapid evaporation of these droplets, results in the generation of an aerosol consisting of micrometer-sized medication particles that are then inhaled.

 Uses 
thumb|Nicorette Inhalator is a vapour inhalator.

Metered-dose inhalers are only one type of inhaler, but they are the most commonly used type. The replacement of chlorofluorocarbons propellants with hydrofluoroalkanes (HFA) resulted in the redesign of metered-dose inhalers in the 1990s. For one variety of beclomethasone inhaler, this redesign resulted in considerably smaller aerosol particles being produced, and led to an increase of potency by a factor of 2.6.

*Asthma inhalers contain a medication that treats the symptoms of asthma.
*Nicotine inhalers allows cigarette smokers to get nicotine without using tobacco, much like nicotine gum or a nicotine patch. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved some nicotine inhaler products for smoking cessation. Nicotine inhalers that are marketed as nicotine replacement therapy should not be confused with electronic cigarettes, which produce an aerosol, usually from a tobacco extract, using a heating coil, while nicotine inhalers produce a noncombusted nicotine aerosol. A study found that ""levels of carcinogens and toxins in e-cigarettes typically exceeded those measured in an FDA-approved nicotine inhaler"". Nicotine inhalers are also known by their nickname of “the puffer”. These devices are made of thin plastic, sometimes resembling a cigarette, or a cylinder shape. They contain a porous nicotine-filled plug, located in the base of the product. When you puff on the inhaler, nicotine aerosol is inhaled and absorbed in the mouth’s lining. Every inhaler delivers almost four hundred puffs of this nicotine vapor. The nicotine inhaler is also temperature sensitive. In cooler weather, less nicotine is delivered. The nicotine inhaler is considered easier to use than the electronic cigarette as it is usually disposable, and contains fewer parts than the electronic cigarette.
** Nicotine inhalers also exist as non-MDIs, for example, the format for the Nicorette Inhalator is an “inhalation vapour solution”.
*''blisters or gel capsules containing the powdered medication to be drawn into the lungs by the user's own breath. These systems tend to be more expensive than the MDI, and patients with severely compromised lung function, such as occurs during an asthma attack, may find it difficult to generate enough airflow to get good function from them.
*Metered-dose inhalers can be used to treat COPD, both in stable state and during lung attacks.

 History 

Before the invention of the MDI, asthma medication was delivered using a squeeze bulb nebulizer which was fragile and unreliable.  The relatively crude nature of these devices also meant that the particles that they generated were relatively large, too large for effective drug delivery to the lungs.  Nonetheless these nebulizers paved the way for inhalation drug delivery providing the inspiration for the MDI.

MDIs were first developed in 1955 by Riker Laboratories, now a subsidiary of 3M Healthcare.  At that time MDIs represented a convergence of two relatively new technologies, the CFC propellant and the Meshburg metering valve which was originally designed for dispensing perfume. The initial design by Riker used a glass canister coated with a vinyl plastic to improve its resilience.  By 1956 Riker had developed two MDI based products, the Medihaler-Ept containing epinephrine and the Medihaler-Iso containing Isoprenaline.  Both products are agonists which provide short term relief from asthma symptoms and have now largely been replaced in asthma treatment by salbutamol, which is more selective.

 Spacers 

Metered-dose inhalers are sometimes used with add-on devices referred to as holding chambers or spacers, which are tubes attached to the inhaler that act as a reservoir or holding chamber and reduce the speed at which the aerosol enters the mouth. They serve to hold the medication that is sprayed by the inhaler. This makes it easier to use the inhaler and helps ensure that more of the medication gets into the lungs instead of just into the mouth or the air. With proper use, a spacer can make an inhaler somewhat more effective in delivering medicine.

Spacers can be especially helpful to adults and children who find a regular metered dose inhaler hard to use. People who use corticosteroid inhalers should use a spacer to prevent getting the medicine in their mouth, where oral yeast infections and dysphonia can occur.

 Lifespan and replacement 


The deposition of the content of drug formulation on the canister surface can result in a shorter shelf life of an MDI inhaler. Applying a suitable surface coating to the components helps to extend this shelf life. Over the years a range of coating processes have been developed that can be applied to both the canister and valve to protect the contents from deposition and degradation.
Gas plasma processing is an industrial technique that is carried out in a vacuum to coat the entire MDI inhaler and involves constant or pulsed excitation of gas by either Radio Frequency (RF) or microwave field to produce an energetic plasma. This coating ensures that the drug formulation does not stick to the interior wall of the MD inhaler and results in the patient receiving the prescribed dose of medication, whilst also extending the product's shelf-life.

A metered dose inhaler contains enough medication for a certain number of actuations (or ""puffs"") which is printed on the canister.  Even though the inhaler may continue to work beyond that number of uses, the amount of medication delivered may not be correct. It is important to keep track of the number of times an inhaler was used, so that it can be replaced after its recommended number of uses. For this reason, several regulatory authorities have requested that manufacturers add a dose counter or dose indicator to the actuator. Several inhalation products are now sold with a dose counter-actuator. Depending on the manufacturer and the product, inhalers are sold as a complete unit or the individual canister as a refill prescription.

 Inhaler technique and use 
While MDIs are commonly used in the treatment of lung-based disorders, their use requires dexterity to complete the required sequential steps to achieve application of these devices.  Incorrect completion of one or more steps in the use of an MDI can substantially reduce the delivery of the administered medication and consequently its effectiveness and safety. Numerous studies have demonstrated that between 50-100% of patients do not use their inhaler devices correctly, with patients often unaware that they are using their inhaled medication incorrectly. Incorrect inhaler technique has been associated with poorer outcomes. Incorrect maintenance and cleaning of metered dose inhalers is also an issue identified in many users, highlighting the need for clear guidance for patients prescribed MDIs.

 Propellants 
thumb|CFC-free Asthalin HFA inhaler
One of the most crucial components of a MDI is its propellant. The propellant provides the force to generate the aerosol cloud and is also the medium in which the active component must be suspended or dissolved. Propellants in MDIs typically make up more than 99% of the delivered dose, so it is the properties of the propellant that dominate more than any other individual factor.  This is often overlooked in literature and in industry because so few propellants are used and their contribution is often taken for granted.  Suitable propellants must pass a stringent set of criteria, they must:
* have a boiling point in the range -100 to +30&nbsp;°C 
* have a density of approximately 1.2 to 1.5 g cm−3 (approximately that of the drug to be suspended or dissolved)
* have a vapour pressure of 40 to 80 psig 
* have no toxicity to the patient 
* be non-flammable 
* be able to dissolve common additives (active ingredients should be either fully soluble or fully insoluble)

 Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
In the early days of MDIs the most commonly used propellants were the chlorofluorocarbons CFC-11, CFC-12 and CFC-114.

In 2008 the Food and Drug Administration announced that inhalers using chlorofluorocarbons as a propellant, such as Primatene Mist, could no longer be manufactured or sold as of 2012. This followed from the U.S. decision to agree to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the ozone layer.

 Hydrofluorocarbons 
CFC propellants have been replaced by hydrofluorocarbon propellants. Concerns about the use of hydrofluorocarbon propellants have however since arisen since these compounds are potent greenhouse gases; propellant released during the use of a single inhaler results in a greenhouse footprint equivalent to greenhouse gases released during a 180-mile car journey.

 Surfactant lipids 
alveoli, thereby reducing the pressure needed to expand the lungs, Thus, commercially available formulations of phospholipids have been designed to spread rapidly over an air-aqueous interface, thereby reducing what is otherwise a very high surface tension of water.

Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the airflow obstruction, and easily triggered bronchospasms. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These may occur a few times a day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, asthma symptoms may become worse at night or with exercise.


Asthma is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and atopic or non-atopic, where atopy refers to a predisposition toward developing a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.


There is no known cure for asthma, but it can be controlled. Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as irritants, and suppressed with the use of inhaled Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or beta2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth. In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.


In 2019 asthma affected approximately 262 million people and caused approximately 461,000 deaths. Most of the deaths occurred in the developing world. Asthma often begins in childhood, and the rates have increased significantly since the 1960s. Asthma was recognized as early as Ancient Egypt. The word ''asthma'' is from the Greek , , which means 'panting'.


Signs and symptoms

Asthma is characterized by recurrent episodes of pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air. Some people with asthma rarely experience symptoms, usually in response to triggers, whereas others may react frequently and readily and experience persistent symptoms.

Associated conditions

A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in people with asthma, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), rhinosinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea. Psychological disorders are also more common, with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16 and 52% and mood disorders in 14–41%. It is not known whether asthma causes psychological problems or psychological problems lead to asthma. Current asthma, but not former asthma, is associated with increased all-cause mortality, heart disease mortality, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality. Asthma, particularly severe asthma, is strongly associated with development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Those with asthma, especially if it is poorly controlled, are at increased risk for radiocontrast reactions.

Cavities occur more often in people with asthma. This may be related to the effect of beta2 agonists decreasing saliva. These medications may also increase the risk of dental erosions.

Causes

Asthma is caused by a combination of complex and incompletely understood environmental and genetic interactions. These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment. It is believed that the recent increased rates of asthma are due to changing epigenetics (heritable factors other than those related to the DNA sequence) and a changing living environment. Asthma that starts before the age of 12 years old is more likely due to genetic influence, while onset after age 12 is more likely due to environmental influence.

Environmental

Many environmental factors have been associated with asthma's development and exacerbation, including allergens, air pollution, and other environmental chemicals. There are some substances that are known to cause asthma in exposed people and they are called Smoking during pregnancy and after delivery is associated with a greater risk of asthma-like symptoms. Low air quality from environmental factors such as traffic pollution or high low-income and minority communities.

Exposure to indoor volatile organic compounds may be a trigger for asthma; formaldehyde exposure, for example, has a positive association. Phthalates in certain types of PVC are associated with asthma in both children and adults. While exposure to pesticides is linked to the development of asthma, a cause and effect relationship has yet to be established. A meta-analysis concluded gas stoves are a major risk factor for asthma, finding around one in eight cases in the U.S. could be attributed to these.


The majority of the evidence does not support a causal role between paracetamol (acetaminophen) or antibiotic use and asthma. A 2014 systematic review found that the association between paracetamol use and asthma disappeared when respiratory infections were taken into account. Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for the child to develop asthma.


Asthma is associated with exposure to indoor allergens. Common indoor allergens include dust mites, cockroaches, animal dander (fragments of fur or feathers), and mold. Efforts to decrease dust mites have been found to be ineffective on symptoms in sensitized subjects. Weak evidence suggests that efforts to decrease mold by repairing buildings may help improve asthma symptoms in adults. Certain viral respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus, may increase the risk of developing asthma when acquired as young children. Certain other infections, however, may decrease the risk.

Hygiene hypothesis

The hygiene hypothesis attempts to explain the increased rates of asthma worldwide as a direct and unintended result of reduced exposure, during childhood, to non-pathogenic bacteria and viruses. It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies. Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction. Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.

Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma. Also, delivery via caesarean section is associated with an increased risk (estimated at 20–80%) of asthma&nbsp;– this increased risk is attributed to the lack of healthy bacterial colonization that the newborn would have acquired from passage through the birth canal. There is a link between asthma and the degree of affluence which may be related to the hygiene hypothesis as less affluent individuals often have more exposure to bacteria and viruses.

Family history is a risk factor for asthma, with many different genes being implicated. If one identical twin is affected, the probability of the other having the disease is approximately 25%. By the end of 2005, 25 genes had been associated with asthma in six or more separate populations, including GSTM1, IL10, LTC4S, IL4R and ADAM33, among others. Many of these genes are related to the immune system or modulating inflammation. Even among this list of genes supported by highly replicated studies, results have not been consistent among all populations tested. In 2006 over 100 genes were associated with asthma in one genetic association study alone; more continue to be found.

Some genetic variants may only cause asthma when they are combined with specific environmental exposures. An example is a specific single nucleotide polymorphism in the CD14 region and exposure to endotoxin (a bacterial product). Endotoxin exposure can come from several environmental sources including tobacco smoke, dogs, and farms. Risk for asthma, then, is determined by both a person's genetics and the level of endotoxin exposure.

Medical conditions

A triad of atopic disease; with asthma occurring at a much greater rate in those who have either hay fever. Asthma has been associated with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg–Strauss syndrome), an autoimmune disease and vasculitis. Individuals with certain types of urticaria may also experience symptoms of asthma.

There is a correlation between obesity and the risk of asthma with both having increased in recent years. Several factors may be at play including decreased respiratory function due to a buildup of fat and the fact that adipose tissue leads to a pro-inflammatory state.

aspirin, and NSAIDs. Use of acid suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.

Exacerbation

Some individuals will have stable asthma for weeks or months and then suddenly develop an episode of acute asthma. Different individuals react to various factors in different ways. Most individuals can develop severe exacerbation from a number of triggering agents.

Home factors that can lead to exacerbation of asthma include mold. viral and bacterial stress may worsen symptoms&nbsp;– it is thought that stress alters the immune system and thus increases the airway inflammatory response to allergens and irritants.

Asthma exacerbations in school‐aged children peak in autumn, shortly after children return to school. This might reflect a combination of factors, including poor treatment adherence, increased allergen and viral exposure, and altered immune tolerance. There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.

Pathophysiology


Asthma is the result of chronic bronchi and bronchioles), which subsequently results in increased contractability of the surrounding smooth muscles. --> This among other factors leads to bouts of narrowing of the airway and the classic symptoms of wheezing. --> The narrowing is typically reversible with or without treatment. --> Occasionally the airways themselves change. Typical changes in the airways include an increase in eosinophils and thickening of the lamina reticularis. --> Chronically the airways' smooth muscle may increase in size along with an increase in the numbers of mucous glands. --> Other cell types involved include T lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. --> There may also be involvement of other components of the immune system, including cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and leukotrienes among others.

Diagnosis
While asthma is a well-recognized condition, there is not one universal agreed upon definition. It is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as ""a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role. The chronic inflammation is associated with airway hyper-responsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing particularly at night or in the early morning. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment"".

There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time. Asthma may be suspected if there is a history of recurrent wheezing, coughing or difficulty breathing and these symptoms occur or worsen due to exercise, viral infections, allergens or air pollution. Spirometry is then used to confirm the diagnosis. In children under the age of six the diagnosis is more difficult as they are too young for spirometry.

Spirometry

Spirometry is recommended to aid in diagnosis and management. It is the single best test for asthma. --> If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 milliliters following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis. --> It however may be normal in those with a history of mild asthma, not currently acting up. As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results. Single-breath diffusing capacity can help differentiate asthma from COPD. It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.

Others

The methacholine challenge involves the inhalation of increasing concentrations of a substance that causes airway narrowing in those predisposed. --> If negative it means that a person does not have asthma; if positive, however, it is not specific for the disease.

Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger. Testing peak expiratory flow is more variable than spirometry, however, and thus not recommended for routine diagnosis. --> It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications. --> It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.

Asthma is clinically classified according to the frequency of symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow rate. Asthma may also be classified as atopic (extrinsic) or non-atopic (intrinsic), based on whether symptoms are precipitated by allergens (atopic) or not (non-atopic). While asthma is classified based on severity, at the moment there is no clear method for classifying different subgroups of asthma beyond this system. Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research. Recently, asthma has been classified based on whether it is associated with type 2 or non–type 2 inflammation. This approach to immunologic classification is driven by a developing understanding of the underlying immune processes and by the development of therapeutic approaches that target type 2 inflammation.

Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of emphysema. Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling. In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli. The combination of asthma with a component of irreversible airway obstruction has been termed the asthma-chronic obstructive disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS). Compared to other people with ""pure"" asthma or COPD, people with ACOS exhibit increased morbidity, mortality and possibly more comorbidities.

An acute asthma exacerbation is commonly referred to as an ''asthma attack''. The classic symptoms are wheezing, and chest pain is often present.

Signs occurring during an asthma attack include the use of accessory paradoxical pulse (a pulse that is weaker during inhalation and stronger during exhalation), and over-inflation of the chest. A blue color of the skin and nails may occur from lack of oxygen.

In a mild exacerbation the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is ≥200&nbsp;L/min, or ≥50% of the predicted best. Moderate is defined as between 80 and 200&nbsp;L/min, or 25% and 50% of the predicted best, while severe is defined as ≤&nbsp;80 L/min, or ≤25% of the predicted best.

Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids. Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.

Brittle asthma is a kind of asthma distinguishable by recurrent, severe attacks. Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication. Type 2 brittle asthma is background well-controlled asthma with sudden severe exacerbations.

Exercise-induced

Exercise can trigger 2 agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma; however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.

Occupational

Asthma as a result of (or worsened by) workplace exposures is a commonly reported occupational disease. Many cases, however, are not reported or recognized as such. It is estimated that 5–25% of asthma cases in adults are work-related. --> A few hundred different agents have been implicated, with the most common being isocyanates, grain and wood dust, colophony, soldering flux, latex, animals, and aldehydes. --> The employment associated with the highest risk of problems include those who spray paint, bakers and those who process food, nurses, chemical workers, those who work with animals, welders, hairdressers and timber workers.

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease

Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as aspirin-induced asthma, affects up to 9% of asthmatics. AERD consists of asthma, nasal polyps, sinus disease, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other NSAID medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen). People often also develop loss of smell and most experience respiratory reactions to alcohol.

Alcohol-induced asthma

Alcohol may worsen asthmatic symptoms in up to a third of people. This may be even more common in some ethnic groups such as the Japanese and those with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol.

 Non-atopic asthma 
Non-atopic asthma, also known as intrinsic or non-allergic, makes up between 10 and 33% of cases. --> There is negative skin test to common inhalant allergens.  --> Often it starts later in life, and women are more commonly affected than men. --> Usual treatments may not work as well. The concept that ""non-atopic"" is synonymous with ""non-allergic"" is called into question by epidemiological data that the prevalence of asthma is closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P<0.0001), indicating that asthma is almost always associated with some sort of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of aeroallergens studied (the ""missing antigen(s)"" hypothesis). For example, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of population-attributable risk (PAR) of ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'' biomarkers in chronic asthma found that the PAR for ''C. pneumoniae''-specific IgE was 47%.

 Infectious asthma 
Infectious asthma is an easily identified clinical presentation. When queried, asthma patients may report that their first asthma symptoms began after an acute lower respiratory tract illness. This type of history has been labelled the ""infectious asthma"" (IA) syndrome, or as ""asthma associated with infection"" (AAWI) to distinguish infection-associated asthma initiation from the well known association of respiratory infections with asthma exacerbations. Reported clinical prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice to 70% in a specialty practice treating mainly severe asthma patients. Additional information on the clinical prevalence  of IA in adult-onset asthma is unavailable because clinicians are not trained to elicit this type of history routinely, and recollection in child-onset asthma is challenging. A population-based incident case-control study in a geographically defined area of Finland reported that 35.8% of new-onset asthma cases had experienced acute bronchitis or pneumonia in the year preceding asthma onset, representing a significantly higher risk compared to randomly selected controls (Odds ratio 7.2, 95% confidence interval 5.2-10).

Differential diagnosis

Many other conditions can cause symptoms similar to those of asthma. --> In children, symptoms may be due to other upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and sinusitis, as well as other causes of airway obstruction including foreign body aspiration, tracheal stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular rings, enlarged lymph nodes or neck masses. Bronchiolitis and other viral infections may also produce wheezing. According to European Respiratory Society, it may not be suitable to label wheezing preschool children with the term ""asthma"" because there is lack of clinical data on inflammation in airways. In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms. --> In both populations vocal cord dysfunction may present similarly.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease can coexist with asthma and can occur as a complication of chronic asthma. After the age of 65, most people with obstructive airway disease will have asthma and COPD. In this setting, COPD can be differentiated by increased airway neutrophils, abnormally increased wall thickness, and increased smooth muscle in the bronchi. However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation. It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.

Prevention

The evidence for the effectiveness of measures to prevent the development of asthma is weak. The in utero, breastfeeding, and increased exposure to daycare or large families, but none are well supported enough to be recommended for this indication.

Early pet exposure may be useful. Results from exposure to pets at other times are inconclusive and it is only recommended that pets be removed from the home if a person has allergic symptoms to said pet.

Dietary restrictions during pregnancy or when breastfeeding have not been found to be effective at preventing asthma in children and are not recommended. Omega-3 consumption, mediterranean diet and anti-oxidants have been suggested by some studies that might help preventing crisis but the evidence is still inconclusive.

Reducing or eliminating compounds known to sensitive people from the work place may be effective. It is not clear if annual influenza vaccinations affects the risk of exacerbations. Immunization, however, is recommended by the World Health Organization. Smoking bans are effective in decreasing exacerbations of asthma.

Management
While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved. The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, pets or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them. If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended. Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms. Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories. The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms; however, real world use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated. People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called ""refractory"" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called ""difficult to treat"" asthma). In practice, it is not possible to distinguish ""refractory"" from ""difficult to treat"" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications. A related issue is that the asthma efficacy trials upon which the pharmacological treatment guidelines are based have systematically excluded the majority of people with asthma. For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking diminishes the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management.

Bronchodilators are recommended for short-term relief of symptoms. --> In those with occasional attacks, no other medication is needed. --> If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended. --> For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used. In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.

People with asthma have higher rates of depression. This is associated with poorer asthma control. Cognitive behavioral therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.

Improving people's knowledge about asthma and using a written action plan has been identified as an important component of managing asthma. Providing educational sessions that include information specific to a person's culture is likely effective. More research is necessary to determine if increasing preparedness and knowledge of asthma among school staff and families using home-based and school interventions results in long term improvements in safety for children with asthma. School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits. These interventions may also reduce the number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma-related quality of life. More research is necessary to determine if shared-decision-making is helpful for managing adults with asthma or if a personalized asthma action plan is effective and necessary. Some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack. However, there is no evidence regarding the use in these instances.

Lifestyle modification

Avoidance of triggers is a key component of improving control and preventing attacks. The most common triggers include nonselective beta-blockers, and sulfite-containing foods. Cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke (passive smoke) may reduce the effectiveness of medications such as corticosteroids. Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma. Dust mite control measures, including air filtration, chemicals to kill mites, vacuuming, mattress covers and others methods had no effect on asthma symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that dehumidifiers are helpful for controlling asthma.

Overall, exercise is beneficial in people with stable asthma. Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma. More research is necessary to determine how effective weight loss is on improving quality of life, the usage of health care services, and adverse effects for people of all ages with asthma.

Medications
Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms; and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation. Antibiotics are generally not needed for sudden worsening of symptoms or for treating asthma at any time.

Medications for asthma exacerbations
thumb|altA round canister above a blue plastic holder|Salbutamol metered dose inhaler commonly used to treat asthma attacks
* Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABA), such as USAN) are the first line treatment for asthma symptoms. They are recommended before exercise in those with exercise induced symptoms.
* Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms and may prevent hospitalizations. Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA. If a child requires admission to hospital additional ipratropium does not appear to help over a SABA. For children over 2 years old with acute asthma symptoms, inhaled anticholinergic medications taken alone is safe but is not as effective as inhaled SABA or SABA combined with inhaled anticholinergic medication. Adults who receive combined inhaled medications that includes short-acting anticholinergics and SABA may be at risk for increased adverse effects such as experiencing a tremor, agitation, and heart beat palpitations compared to people who are treated with SABA by itself.
* Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs. They are however not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.
* Corticosteroids can also help with the acute phase of an exacerbation because of their antiinflamatory properties. The benefit of systemic and oral corticosteroids is well established. Inhaled or nebulized corticosteroids can also be used. For adults and children who are in the hospital due to acute asthma, systemic (IV) corticosteroids improve symptoms. A short course of corticosteroids after an acute asthma exacerbation may help prevent relapses and reduce hospitalizations.
* Other remedies, less established, are intravenous or nebulized magnesium sulfate and helium mixed with oxygen. Aminophylline could be used with caution as well.
* Mechanical ventilation is the last resort in case of severe hypoxemia.
* Intravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment. Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta-2 agonist treatment.

 Long–term control 
thumb|altA round canister above an orange plastic holder|Fluticasone propionate metered dose inhaler commonly used for long-term control
* Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control. Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed. Dosage depends on the severity of symptoms. High dosage and long term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are  growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis. Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations. Commonly used corticosteroids are  budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone and ciclesonide.
* Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. In children this benefit is uncertain. When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects, and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk. Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations. Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.
* Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children. A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.  there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.
* Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.
* Oral Theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their used is minimized because of their side effects.
* Omalizumab, a monoclonal Antibody Against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by decreasing the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role at allergic asthma.
* Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide have not been shown to be beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old, but is not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.
* There is no strong evidence to recommend chloroquine medication as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (for those who are not able to tolerate inhaled steroids). Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteriods by mouth (""steroid sparing"") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.
* Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added GINA-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined. Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve  pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities. Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with ""difficult-to-treat"" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome - ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin. However, these groups of asthma patients have not been studied in randomized treatment trials and patient selection needs to be carefully individualized.

For children with asthma which is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain. In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth. Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life. Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalisation is uncertain.

Delivery methods

Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an asthma spacer or as a dry powder inhaler. The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug. A nebulizer may also be used. Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms. However, insufficient evidence is available to determine whether a difference exists in those with severe disease. For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied. There is no strong evidence for the use of intravenous LABA for adults or children who have acute asthma. There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.

Adverse effects

Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects. Risks include thrush, the development of cataracts, and a slightly slowed rate of growth. Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush. Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.

Others

Inflammation in the lungs can be estimated by the level of exhaled nitric oxide. The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.

When asthma is unresponsive to usual medications, other options are available for both emergency management and prevention of flareups. Additional options include:
* Humidified hypoxia if saturations fall below 92%.
* Corticosteroid by mouth are recommended with five days of prednisone being the same 2 days of dexamethasone. One review recommended a seven-day course of steroids.
* Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate severe acute asthma attacks. In adults intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions. Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulised) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults. Overall, high quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.
* Heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, may also be considered in severe unresponsive cases.
* Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.
* Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists. Their use in acute exacerbations is controversial.
* The dissociative anesthetic ketamine is theoretically useful if intubation and mechanical ventilation is needed in people who are approaching respiratory arrest; however, there is no evidence from clinical trials to support this.  A 2012 Cochrane review found no significant benefit from the use of ketamine in severe acute asthma in children.
* For those with severe persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchoscopies. While it may increase exacerbation frequency in the first few months it appears to decrease the subsequent rate. --> Effects beyond one year are unknown.
* interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations. There is limited evidence for improved health-related quality of life and lung function.
* Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.
* It is unclear if non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in children is of use as it has not been sufficiently studied.

 Adherence to asthma treatments 
Staying with a treatment approach for preventing asthma exacerbations can be challenging, especially if the person is required to take medicine or treatments daily. Reasons for low adherence range from a conscious decision to not follow the suggested medical treatment regime for various reasons including avoiding potential side effects, misinformation, or other beliefs about the medication. Problems accessing the treatment and problems administering the treatment effectively can also result in lower adherence. Various approaches have been undertaken to try and improve adherence to treatments to help people prevent serious asthma exacerbations including digital interventions.

Alternative medicine

Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy. There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.

Evidence is insufficient to support the usage of vitamin C or vitamin E for controlling asthma. There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm. Fish oil dietary supplements (marine n-3 fatty acids) and reducing dietary sodium do not appear to help improve asthma control. In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites does not reduce acute exacerbations or improve control. There is no strong evidence to suggest that vitamin D supplements improve day-to-day asthma symptoms or a person's lung function. There is no strong evidence to suggest that adults with asthma should avoid foods that contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). There have not been enough high-quality studies performed to determine if children with asthma should avoid eating food that contains MSG.

osteopathic, physiotherapeutic and respiratory therapeutic maneuvers, have insufficient evidence to support their use in treating asthma.  Pulmonary rehabilitation, however, may improve quality of life and functional exercise capacity when compared to usual care for adults with asthma. The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.  Thus an expert panel felt that evidence was insufficient to support its use. There is no clear evidence that breathing exercises are effective for treating children with asthma.

Prognosis
The prognosis for asthma is generally good, especially for children with mild disease. Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care. In 2010 the death rate was 170 per million for males and 90 per million for females. Rates vary between countries by 100-fold.

Globally it causes moderate or severe disability in 19.4&nbsp;million people  (16&nbsp;million of which are in low and middle income countries). Of asthma diagnosed during childhood, half of cases will no longer carry the diagnosis after a decade. Airway remodeling is observed, but it is unknown whether these represent harmful or beneficial changes. More recent data find that severe asthma can result in airway remodeling and the ""asthma with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease syndrome (ACOS)"" that has a poor prognosis.  Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorates a decline in lung function. Asthma in children also has negative effects on quality of life of their parents.

Epidemiology

thumb|upright1.6|Rates of asthma in 2017
In 2019, approximately 262 million people worldwide were affected by asthma and approximately 461,000 people died from the disease. Rates vary between countries with prevalences between 1 and 18%. It is more common in developed than developing countries. One thus sees lower rates in Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. Within developed countries it is more common in those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common in the affluent. The reason for these differences is not well known. Low and middle income countries make up more than 80% of the mortality.

While asthma is twice as common in boys as girls, severe asthma occurs at equal rates. In contrast adult women have a higher rate of asthma than men and it is more common in the young than the old. In 2010, children with asthma experienced over 900,000 emergency department visits, making it the most common reason for admission to the hospital following an emergency department visit in the US in 2011.

Global rates of asthma have increased significantly between the 1960s and 2008 with it being recognized as a major public health problem since the 1970s. Rates of asthma have plateaued in the developed world since the mid-1990s with recent increases primarily in the developing world. Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States and 5% of people in the United Kingdom. Canada, Australia and New Zealand have rates of about 14–15%.

The average death rate from 2011 to 2015 from asthma in the UK was about 50% higher than the average for the European Union and had increased by about 5% in that time. Children are more likely see a physician due to asthma symptoms after school starts in September.

Population-based epidemiological studies describe temporal associations between acute respiratory illnesses, asthma, and development of severe asthma with irreversible airflow limitation (known as the asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ""overlap"" syndrome, or ACOS). Additional prospective population-based data indicate that ACOS seems to represent a form of severe asthma, characterised by more frequent hospitalisations, and to be the result of early-onset asthma that has progressed to fixed airflow obstruction.

Economics

From 2000 to 2010, the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay in the United States for children remained relatively stable at about $3,600, whereas the average cost per asthma-related hospital stay for adults increased from $5,200 to $6,600. In 2010, Medicaid was the most frequent primary payer among children and adults aged 18–44 years in the United States; private insurance was the second most frequent payer. Among both children and adults in the lowest income communities in the United States there is a higher rate of hospital stays for asthma in 2010 than those in the highest income communities.

 History 

thumb|The Gold-dust Book of Cold Damage dated '1st year of the Zhengyuan reign period of the Yuan dynasty' (1341) Wellcome.
Asthma was recognized in ancient Egypt and was treated by drinking an incense mixture known as kyphi. It was officially named as a specific respiratory problem by Hippocrates circa 450 BC, with the Greek word for ""panting"" forming the basis of our modern name. In 200 BC it was believed to be at least partly related to the emotions. In the 12th century the Jewish physician-philosopher Maimonides wrote a treatise on asthma in Arabic, based partly on Arabic sources, in which he discussed the symptoms, proposed various dietary and other means of treatment, and emphasized the importance of climate and clean air. Chinese Traditional Medicine also offered medication for asthma, as indicated by a surviving 14th century manuscript curated by the Wellcome Foundation.

In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the chloroform liniment. Medical treatment in 1880 included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called Epinephrine was first referred to in the treatment of asthma in 1905. Oral corticosteroids began to be used for this condition in the 1950s while inhaled corticosteroids and selective short acting beta agonist came into wide use in the 1960s.

A well-documented case in the 19th century was that of young Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919). At that time there was no effective treatment. Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health partly related to his asthma. He experienced recurring nighttime asthma attacks that felt as if he was being smothered to death, terrifying the boy and his parents.

During the 1930s to 1950s, asthma was known as one of the ""holy seven"" psychosomatic illnesses. Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other talking cures. As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.

In January 2021, an appeal court in France overturned a deportation order against a 40-year-old Bangladeshi man, who was a patient of asthma. His lawyers had argued that the dangerous levels of pollution in Bangladesh could possibly lead to worsening of his health condition, or even premature death.



Notes"
Dynamic hyperinflation,"Dynamic hyperinflation is a phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume. In simpler terms, this means that a new breath starts before the usual amount of air has been breathed out, leading to a build-up of air in the lungs, and causing breathing in and out to take place when the lung is nearly full.

Asthma

Dynamic hyperinflation can occur in patients with asthma who are breathing spontaneously. It is a physiologic response to airflow obstruction and exists, to an extent, because increasing lung volume tends to increase airway caliber and can reduce the resistive work of breathing. However, in patients with severe asthma it becomes maladaptive, occurring at the expense of increased mechanical load and elastic work of breathing. Dynamic hyperinflation can cause alveolar overdistention resulting in hypoxemia, hypotension, or alveolar rupture. Dynamic hyperinflation increases the magnitude of the drop in airway pressure that the patient must generate to trigger a breath, thereby increasing the patient's workload.

Status asthmaticus

Patients with acute severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for progressive air trapping and alveolar hyperinflation, which may lead to alveolar rupture and hemodynamic compromise. Airflow obstruction during expiration slows lung emptying and inspiration may be initiated before exhalation is complete. The phenomenon that occurs when a new breath begins before the lung has reached the static equilibrium volume is called dynamic hyperinflation.

Interventions
Interventions to correct air-trapping include decreasing the respiratory rate (increasing expiratory time), increasing inspiratory flow rates (decreasing the inspiratory time) and lowering the tidal volume.

Adults
In adults, it has been demonstrated that limiting minute ventilation is the key to avoiding dynamic hyperinflation; keeping the minute ventilation under 115/mL/kg is recommended"
Bronchospasm,"Bronchospasm or a bronchial spasm is a sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the bronchioles. It is caused by the release (degranulation) of substances from mast cells or basophils under the influence of anaphylatoxins. It causes difficulty in breathing which ranges from mild to severe.

Bronchospasms occur in LABA drugs (to treat COPD), and other drugs.  Bronchospasms can present as a sign of giardiasis.

Some factors that contribute to bronchospasm include consuming certain foods, taking certain medicines, allergic responses to insects, and fluctuating hormone levels, particularly in women.
Bronchospasms are one of several conditions associated with cold housing.

The overactivity of the bronchioles' muscle is a result of exposure to a stimulus which under normal circumstances would cause little or no response. The resulting constriction and inflammation causes a narrowing of the airways and an increase in hypoxia.

Bronchospasms are a serious potential complication of placing a breathing tube during general anesthesia. When the airways spasm or constrict in response to the irritating stimulus of the breathing tube, it is difficult to maintain the airway and the patient can become apneic. During general anesthesia, signs of bronchospasm include wheezing, high peak inspiratory pressures, increased intrinsic PEEP, decreased expiratory tidal volumes, and an upsloping capnograph (obstructive pattern).&nbsp; In severe cases, there may be complete inability to ventilate and loss of ETCO2 as well as hypoxia and desaturation.

Cause
Bronchospasms can occur for a number of reasons. Lower respiratory tract conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and emphysema can result in contraction of the airways. Other causes are side effects of topical decongestants such as oxymetazoline and phenylephrine. Both of these medications activate alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that result in smooth muscle constriction. Non-selective beta blockers are known to facilitate bronchospasm as well. Beta blockers bind to the β2 receptors and block the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine causing shortness of breath.

Additionally, the pediatric population is more susceptible to disease and complications from bronchospasm due to their airway diameter being smaller; applying Poiseuille's Law to the airways it is clear that airflow resistance through a tube is inversely related to the radius of the tube to the fourth power, therefore, decreases in airway results in significant flow impediments.

Diagnosis
Signs and symptoms:
* Wheezing
* Diminished breath sounds
* Prolonged expiration
* Increase airway pressures (in ventilated patients)

Treatment

Beta 2 agonists

Beta2-adrenergic agonists are recommended for bronchospasm.
* Short acting (SABA)
** Terbutaline
** Salbutamol
** Levosalbutamol
* Long acting (LABA)
** Formoterol
** Salmeterol
* Others
** Epinephrine - titrate to effect (e.g. 10-50 mcg IV), especially in setting of hemodynamic compromise
** increasing anesthetic depth
** IV magnesium
** Increase FiO2 to 100% and consider manual ventilation

Muscarinic Acetylcholine receptor antagonist


The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to decrease sympathetic response by slowing the heart rate and constricting the smooth muscle tissue. Ongoing research and successful clinical trials have shown that agents such as diphenhydramine, atropine and Ipratropium bromide (all of which act as receptor antagonists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors) are effective for treating asthma and COPD-related symptoms."
Feline asthma,"Feline asthma is a common allergic respiratory disease in wheezing, pollutants. Feline asthma can also be attributed to lung damage caused by long-term exposure to second-hand smoke.

Signs and symptoms
thumb|An adult cat having a coughing fit 
Feline asthma occurs with the inflammation of the small passageways of a cat's lungs. During the attack the lungs will thicken and constrict, making it difficult for the cat to breathe. Mucus may be released by the lungs into the airway, resulting in fits of coughing and wheezing. Some cats experience a less severe version of an asthma attack and only endure some slight coughing. The obvious signs that a cat is having a respiratory attack are: coughing, wheezing, blue lips and gums, squatting with shoulders hunched and neck extended, rapid open mouth breathing or gasping for air, gagging up foamy mucus, and overall weakness.

Diagnosis
Owners often notice their cat coughing several times per day. Cat coughing sounds different from human coughing, usually sounding more like the cat is passing a Veterinarians will classify the severity of feline asthma based on the medical signs. There are a number of heartworms, upper and lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, cardiomyopathy and lymphocytic plasmacytic stomatitis all mimic asthmatic symptoms. Medical signs, pulmonary radiographs, and a positive response to steroids help confirm the diagnosis.

While radiographs can be helpful for diagnosis, airway sampling through transtracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lavage is often necessary. More recently, computed tomography has been found to be more readily available and accurate in distinguishing feline tracheobronchitis from bronchopneumonia.

Treatment
Although feline asthma is incurable, ongoing treatments allow many domestic cats to live normal lives. Feline asthma is commonly managed through use of bronchodilators for mild cases, or glucocorticosteroids with bronchodilators for moderate to severe cases.

Previously, standard veterinary practice recommended injected and oral medications for control of the disease. These drugs may have systemic side effects including diabetes and pancreatitis. In 2000, Dr. Philip Padrid pioneered inhaled medications using a pediatric chamber and mask using fluticasone and salbutamol. Inhaled treatments reduce or eliminate systemic effects. In 2003 a chamber called the AeroKat Feline Aerosol Chamber was designed specifically for cats, significantly improving efficiency and reducing cost for the caregiver. Medicine can also be administered using a human baby spacer device. Inhaled steroid usually takes 10–14 days to reach an effective dose.

Prevention
Feline asthma and other respiratory diseases may be prevented by cat owners by eliminating as many molds, dust from cat litter, perfumes, room fresheners, carpet deodorizers, hairspray, aerosol cleaners, cigarette smoke, and some foods. Avoid using cat litters that create excessive dust, scented cat litters or litter additives. Of course eliminating all of these can be difficult and unnecessary, especially since a cat is only affected by one or two. It can be very challenging to find the allergen that is creating asthmatic symptoms in a particular cat and requires a lot of work on both the owner's and the veterinarian's part. But just like any disease, the severity of an asthma attack can be propelled by more than just the allergens, common factors include: stress, parasites and pre-existing heart conditions. Dry air encourages asthma attacks so a humidifier, especially during winter months, is advised.

Risk factors 
Studies show that cats between the ages of two and eight years have the greatest risk of developing a respiratory disease. Siamese and Himalayan breeds and breed mixes seem to be most prone to asthma. Some studies also indicate that more female cats seem to be affected by asthma than male cats.

Notes"
Asthma-related microbes,"Chronic ''Mycoplasma'' pneumonia and ''Chlamydia'' pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma. Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood. These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV). Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age. HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development. In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma. Thus, ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'', ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'' and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma.

Asthma
According to Hertzen (2002), a common characteristic of asthmatic patients is to have epithelial cells that respond to injury by enhancing the capability of producing proinflammatory and profibrogenic cytokines, instead of repairing the injured epithelial layer.  As a result, inflammation and associated healing process leads to scar formation and tissue remodelling, which are symptoms that can be found in almost all asthmatics patients. Thus, asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. Asthma is divided into two subgroups: atopic (extrinsic) and non-atopic (intrinsic). The atopic subgroup is closely associated with family history of the disease, whereas the non-atopic subgroup has its onset in adulthood and it is not caused by inheritance. It is known that non-atopic asthma has a more severe clinical course than atopic asthma. Non-atopic asthma may be caused by chronic viral, bacterial infections, or colonization with pathogenic bacteria.

The distinction between atopic and non-atopic asthma is nuanced. ""Atopic"" is defined as having one or more positive skin tests to a battery of common aeroallergens, however, compared to people without asthma both atopic and non-atopic asthmatics have elevated levels of serum IgE (the ""allergic"" antibody) that is believed to be more directly responsible for asthma symptoms. A recent meta-analysis reported that the overall population attributable risk for ''C. pneumoniae''-specific IgE in chronic asthma was 47% and was strongly and positively associated with disease severity. Population-attributable risk is the proportion of disease that is potentially attributable to the risk factor under investigation, indicating the potential for infection with this ""stealth pathogen"" as a significant contributor to asthma incidence and prevalence.

Associated microorganisms

''Chlamydophila pneumoniae''


General descriptions
File:Chlamydia pneumoniae.jpg

''Chlamydophila pneumoniae'', formerly known as ''Chlamydia pneumoniae'', is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Chlamydiae, order Chlamydiales, and genus ''Chlamydophila''.  It is rod-shaped and Gram-negative.  It has a characteristic pear-shaped elementary body (EB) that is surrounded by a periplasmic space, which makes it morphologically distinct from the round EBs of ''C. trachomatis'' and ''C. psittaci''.  ''C. pneumoniae'' is non-motile and utilizes aerobic respiration. As an obligate intracellular bacterium, ''C. pneumoniae'' is both parasitic and mesophilic.

Biological interactions with host
''C. pneumoniae'' is able to grow in monocytes, macrophages, endothelial and smooth muscle cells.  It replicates within the host cell cytoplasm. Due to the fact that it does not have the ability to synthesize its own ATP, it is entirely dependent on energy produced by their host.   Reinfection of the host with ''C. pneumoniae'' is common because the memory immunity elicited by ''C. pneumoniae'' is short-lived and partial. In addition, ''C. pneumoniae'' infection tends to be persistence due to IFN-γ, penicillin and nutrient deficiencies.  These deficiencies prevent ''C.pneumoniae'' from completing their normal developmental cycle, leading to the formation of aberrant, noninfectious ''C. pneumoniae'' that persist in the human host.  C. pneumonia infection may not only be persistent and chronic, but it also has irreversible tissue injury and scarring processes, which are symptoms in asthma patients. Infection with ''C. pneumoniae'' induces both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.  Among the two immune responses, cell-mediated immune response that involves CD8+ T cells in particular is crucial to eradicate ''C. pneumoniae'', whereas the humoral immune response appears to be rather ineffective in protection against C. pneumonia infection.  In fact, CD8+ T cells are so important that if it is absent in the host, the C. pneumonia infection would progress rapidly. Although cell-mediated immune response is responsible for the clearance of ''C. pneumoniae'', this response can be harmful to the host because it favours the development of inflammation that can lead to asthma.

Roles in asthma
There is a strong association of ''C. pneumoniae'' with long-standing asthma among the non-atopic asthma in comparison to atopic asthma.  In fact, the severity of asthma can be determined by the elevated titres to ''C. pneumoniae'', but not to other potential pathogens such as ''Mycoplasma pneumoniae'', adenovirus, influenza A and B or parainfluenza virus.  It is hypothesized that ''C. pneumoniae'' is associated with asthma because ''C. pneumoniae'' has been found to cause ciliostasis in bronchial epithelial cells.  Meanwhile, sero-epidemiological data also provide evidences to support that ''C. pneumoniae'' plays a role in asthma by amplifying inflammation and inciting the disease process.  The association of ''C. pneumoniae'' and asthma begins with ''C. pneumoniae'' producing 60-kDa heat shock proteins that provide a prolonged antigenic stimulation.  This particular heat shock protein is known as a member of hsp60 family of stress proteins, which can be found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The production of hsp60 remains unaltered even when ''C. pneumoniae'' is dormant and does not replicate, since that hsp60 serves as a protective antigen.  Its antigenic stimulation strongly amplifies chronic inflammation by increasing the production of proinflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ by infected cells, which ultimately leads to immunopathological tissue damage and scarring in the asthmatic lungs.  Furthermore, infection with ''C. pneumonia'' also induces serum immunoglobulin IgA, and IgG responses, which are associated with chronic asthma. Most strikingly, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that ''C. pneumoniae''-specific IgE was associated with almost half of the asthma cases studied. Lastly, a growing body of evidence from animal model studies finds that ''C. pneumoniae'' infection not only creates the ""asthma phenotype"" but also induces previously non-allergic animals to display allergic responses to exogenous (i.e., non-chlamydial) allergens.

''Mycoplasma pneumoniae''


General descriptions


''M. pneumoniae'' is a bacterium that belongs to the phylum Firmicutes, class Mollicutes, order Mycoplasmatales and family Mycoplasmataceae.  It is either filamentous or spherical. Individual spindle-shaped cells of ''M. pneumoniae'' are 1 to 2&nbsp;µm long and 0.1 to 0.2&nbsp;µm wide.  ''M. pneumoniae'' is a motile, mesophilic bacterium that exhibits obligate aerobic respiration. It is an extracellular, host-associated bacterium that lacks a cell wall  and is unable to survive outside of a host due to osmotic instability in the environment.

Biological interactions with host
''M. pneumoniae'' can cause infections in humans, animals, plants, and cell cultures. It is a parasitic bacterium that invades the mucosal membranes of the upper and lower respiratory tract, including nasopharynx, throat, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.  In order to survive, ''M. pneumoniae'' needs essential nutrients and compounds such as amino acids, cholesterol, precursors to nucleic acid synthesis, and fatty acids obtained from the mucosal epithelial cells of the host.  Its adhesion proteins attach to tracheal epithelial cells by sialoglycoproteins or sialoglycolipid receptors, which are located on its cell surface.  It may cause injury to the respiratory epithelial cell after its attachment. The injury of host epithelial cells caused by ''M. pneumoniae'' adhesion is thought to be due to the production of highly reactive species: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radicals (O2–).  ''M. pneumoniae'' has the potential for intracellular localization. The intracellular existence of ''M. pneumoniae'' could facilitate the establishment of latent or chronic states, circumvent mycoplasmacidal immune mechanisms, its ability to cross mucosal barriers and gain access to internal tissues. Besides, fusion of the mycoplasmal cell membrane with that of the host not only results in the release of various hydrolytic enzymes produced by the ''mycoplasma'', but also leads to the insertion of mycoplasmal membrane components into the host cell membrane, a process that could potentially alter receptor recognition sites and affect cytokine induction and expression.  As stated by Nisar et al. (2007), ''M. pneumonia'' can persist in the respiratory tract up to several months after recovery from acute pneumonia.  In fact, ''M. pneumonia'' can be cultured from respiratory secretions even after the pneumonia patients are treated with effective antibiotics.  Thus, M. pneumonia infection is chronic and persistent. Besides, Nisar et al. (2007) also adds that M. pneumonia infection causes pulmonary structural abnormalities, resulting in a decrease in expiratory flow rates and an increase in airways hyper-responsiveness in non-asthmatic individuals.

Roles in asthma
M. pneumonia infection is responsible for triggering exacerbation of asthma in 3.3 to 50% in such cases.  Furthermore, ''M. pneumonia'' may also precede the onset of asthma, because patients with an acute infection by ''M. pneumonia'', followed by the development of asthma, have significant improvement in lung function and asthma symptoms after they are given antimicrobial treatment against ''M. pneumonia''. The release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to M. pneumoniae infection has been indicated as a possible mechanism leading to bronchial asthma.  This is because the increase of cytokine production results in a continuing inflammatory response in the airway, followed by negative effects such as immunopathological tissue damage and scarring as described in the ''C. pneumonia''’s role in asthma section. Furthermore, patients with asthma are found to have an increased release of type II cytokines, especially IL4 and IL5, but a normal or low level of type I cytokine production. Similarly, M. pneumoniae infection promotes a T helper type 2 response, which is why ''M pneumoniae''-positive patients with asthma have increased airways expression of tumour necrosis factor a, IL4 and IL5. The T helper type 2 predominant airways disease caused by M. pneumonia infection may lead to IgE-related hyper-responsiveness and eosinophil function, resulting in an onset of asthma.  There is also a possibility that M. pneumoniae infection may destroy respiratory mucosal cells and facilitate the penetration of antigens into the mucosa.  A study done by Laitinen et al. (1976) suggests that M. pneumoniae infection denude the epithelial surface and expose irritant receptors.  On top of that, ''M. pneumoniae'' induces the activation of mast cells by releasing serotonin and hexosaminidase.  By producing antigen, ''M. pneumonia'' is capable of initiating an antibody response. Its antigen interacts with IgE that attaches to mast cells, leading to the stimulation of histamine release followed by airway obstruction.

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs)


General descriptions
File:Human rhinovirus.jpg

Rhinoviruses are known to be the most important common cold viruses.  They are ssRNA positive-strand viruses with no DNA stage, and are classified within the family Picornaviridae.  Rhinoviruses are small, with the length of approximately 30&nbsp;nm, and do not contain an envelope.  Their icosahedral capsids contain 4 proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. VP1, VP2, and VP3 are located on the surface of the capsid and are responsible for the antigenic diversity of Rhinoviruses.  In contrast, VP4 is located inside the virus and its function is to anchor the RNA core to the viral capsid.  While sharing basic properties with enteroviruses, such as size, shape, nucleic acid composition, and ether-resistance, rhinoviruses are distinguished from enteroviruses by having a greater buoyant density and a susceptibility to inactivation if they are exposed to an acidic environment.  Nevertheless, they share a common ancestor with enteroviruses.

Biological interactions with host
The optimal temperature for rhinovirus replication is 33-35&nbsp;°C, which corresponds to the temperature of nasal mucosa. At 37&nbsp;°C virus replication rate falls to 10% to 50% of optimum.  This may be the major reason why rhinoviruses can replicate better in the nasal passages and upper tracheobronchial tree than in the lower respiratory tract.  Most of the rhinovirus serotypes bind to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), whereas approximately 10% of the serotypes bind to the low-density lipoprotein receptor.  Normally, rhinoviruses would infect small clusters of cells in the epithelial layer with little cellular cytotoxicity.  Although an increase in polymorphonuclear neutrophils are shown in infected nasal epithelium, little or no mucosal damage occurs from the infection.  Nevertheless, rhinovirus infection leads to symptoms of the common cold, which is primarily an upper airway illness.  Rhinovirus receptors are insensitive to neuraminidase but are sensitive to proteolytic enzymes.

Roles in asthma 
Asthmatic subjects in 9 to 11 years old, 80% to 85% of asthma exacerbations that were associated with reduced peak expiratory flow rates and wheezing were due to viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). High rates of asthma attacks due to rhinovirus infection are also found in adults.  It turns out that rhinovirus are capable of inducing epithelial cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines that result in airway hyperresponsiveness, neurogenic inflammatory responses, mucous secretion, inflammatory cell recruitment and activation, and plasma leakage. To support this statement, asthmatic subjects that are infected with rhinovirus have demonstrated an increase in airway hyperresponsiveness, airway obstruction, and inflammation. Similarly, rhinovirus infection has caused subjects with allergic rhinitis but no history of asthma to have a significantly increased airway hyperreactivity as well as a significantly increased incidence of late asthmatic reactions. This shows that in addition to causing airway hyperreactivity, rhinovirus also promotes the onset of non-atopic asthma.  Furthermore, rhinovirus infection also promotes eosinophil recruitment to airway segments after antigen challenges, and thus intensifies airway inflammatory response to antigens, leading to the development of asthma."
Epidemiology of asthma,"thumb|upright1.6|Rates of asthma rates in 2017
As of 2011, approximately 235 million people worldwide were affected by developed than developing countries. Rates are lower in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa. Within developed countries it is more common among those who are economically disadvantaged while in contrast in developing countries it is more common amongst the affluent. The reason for these differences is not well known.

While asthma is twice as common in boys as girls, severe asthma occurs at equal rates. Among adults, however, asthma is twice as common in women as men.

Increasing frequency
thumb|The prevalence of childhood asthma in the United States has increased since 1980, especially in younger children.
Rates of asthma have increased significantly between the 1960s and 2008  with it being recognized as a major public health problem since the 1970s. Some 9% of US children had asthma in 2001, compared with just 3.6% in 1980. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that some 10% of the Swiss population have asthma as of 2007, compared with 2% some 25–30 years ago. In the United States the age-adjusted prevalence of asthma increased from 7.3 to 8.2 percent during the years 2001 through 2009.

Region specific data
United States
Asthma affects approximately 7% of the population of the United States and causes approximately 4,210 deaths per year. In 2005, asthma affected more than 22 million people, including 6 million children, and accounted for nearly 500,000 hospitalizations that same year. In 2010, asthma accounted for more than one-quarter of admitted emergency department visits in the U.S. among children aged 1–9 years, and it was a frequent diagnosis among children aged 10–17 years. From 2000 through 2010, the rate of pediatric hospital stays for asthma declined from 165 to 130 per 100,000 population, respectively, whereas the rate for adults remained about 119 per 100,000 population.

Asthma prevalence in the U.S. is higher than in most other countries in the world, but varies drastically between ethnic populations. Asthma prevalence is highest in Puerto Ricans, Latino, African Americans, Filipinos, Irish Americans, and Native Hawaiians, and lowest in Mexicans and Koreans. Rates of asthma-related hospital admissions in 2010 were more than three times higher among African American children and two times higher for African American and Latino adults compared with White and Asian and Pacific Islander people. Also, children who are born in low-income families have higher risk of asthma.

Asthma prevalence also differs between populations of the same ethnicity who are born and live in different places. U.S.-born Mexican populations, for example, have higher asthma rates than non-U.S. born Mexican populations that are living in the U.S.

United Kingdom
Asthma affects approximately 5% of the United Kingdom's population. In England, an estimated 261,400 people were newly diagnosed with asthma in 2005; 5.7 million people had an asthma diagnosis and were prescribed 32.6 million asthma-related prescriptions.

 Canada 
Data depicts an increasing trend in asthma prevalence among Canada's population. In 2000-2001 asthma prevalence was monitored at 6.5%; by 2010-2011 a 4.3% increase was shown, with asthma prevalence totaling 10.8% of Canada's population.

Furthermore, asthma prevalence varies among the provinces of Canada; the highest prevalence is Ontario at 12.1%, and the lowest is Nunavut at 3.8%. Though there is an overall decrease in the incidence of new asthma cases in Canada, prevalence is rising. This can be attributed to a decrease in case-specific mortality due to improved management and control of asthma and its symptoms.

 Latin and Central America 
It is approximated that 40 million Latin Americans live with asthma.

In some reports, urban residency within Latin America has been found to be associated with an increased prevalence of asthma. Childhood asthma prevalence was found to be higher than 15 percent in a majority of Latin American countries. Similarly, a study published relating to asthma prevalence in Havana, Cuba estimated that approximately 9 percent of children under the age of 15 are undiagnosed for asthma, possible due to lack of resources in the region.

 Japan 
The prevalence of asthma in adults in Japan is rapidly increasing, however there is a significant difference for the children in Japan. The mean prevalence of asthma in Japan has increased from about 1% to 10% or higher in children and to about 6–10% in adults since the 1960s. There has been a 1.5 fold increase in the prevalence of asthma per decade in Japan from the 1960s. Three surveys done from 1985, 1999 and 2006 show adult asthma is increasing, while the same surveys indicate that the prevalence of asthma in children is decreasing. To compare this to another Asia-Pacific country the estimated prevalence of asthma in male and female children in Mongolia in a 2009 ISSAC study was 20.9% and 21.0%

 Asia 
Data regarding the epidemiology of asthma in the continent of Asia as whole is scarce, particularly regarding adult populations. However, similarly to much of the rest of the globe, prevalence of childhood asthma appears to be rising. Systematic childhood studies, such as the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), provide data regarding the epidemiology of asthma among Asia's youth population. Asthma prevalence among Asia's adult population is less clear in comparison due to the comparatively higher monitoring of younger populations. However, the data available points to a positive correlation between age and asthma prevalence. Findings indicate that the prevalence of asthma among the Asian adult population is less than 5%; while findings pertaining to elderly populations illustrate a rate somewhere between 1.3 and 15.3%.

International migration
In a review of studies on the prevalence of asthma among migrant populations, those born in high-income countries were found to have higher rates of asthma than migrants. Second-generation migrants had a higher risk of asthma than first-generation migrants, and the prevalence of asthma increases with longer time of residence in the host country. This confirms the role of the environment in the development of asthma.

 Regional differences 
A survey conducted by the ISSAC Steering Committee conducted a study from 1992 to 1993 in adults aged 22 to 44 comparing the prevalence of asthma in 10 developed countries. An important note to consider is the population differences between these countries. The United States population in 1992 was 256.9 million, 14.5 times that of Australia (17.5 mil), and 4.5 times of the United Kingdom (57.51 mil). However, Australia and the UK have a higher prevalence than the US by 2.4 times on the lower end and 4.6 times on the higher end. In another study taken in 1992 for Japan the prevalence of asthma in Japan was 13% with a population of 124.2 million.

 Social determinants 
Differences in socioeconomic status has shown disparities among the prevalence of asthma across populations. In the United States, socioeconomic status is associated with race, due to population trends, Black and Hispanic populations are more likely to have asthma, due to higher concentrations in low-income areas. In other areas of the world, the same trend that lower socioeconomic status is related to higher severity of asthma symptoms. Airway reactivity and symptoms for children of low socioeconomic status in Canada tend to be higher than those of higher-income areas. The contrast between residents of rural and suburban areas can be seen in a study of Kenya and Ethiopia,  where prevalence of asthma is lower in rural areas, and higher in urban areas. A similar trend can be seen in the United States, where an urban-rural gradient shows the increase in the prevalence of asthma closer to the inner city.

A study published by https://bmcpulmmed.biomedcentral.com/about?gclidCj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0WZVQ4DV9rP7bCYT1ydJERCEbWkqGiF1G6oAMKQbEauMRRAr9ewE18aAoOnEALw_wcB BMC Pulmonary Medicine shows the relation between those who live in large urban, small urban, and rural areas. Large urban can be classified as the inner-city, and small urban is related to suburban areas. The inner city and rural communities have several commonalities that are important when determining socioeconomic status. They are both more likely to have higher poverty rates, and higher mortality rates, thus having a lower health status than suburban residents. It was found that asthma prevalence in large urban areas was 20.9%, small urban was 21.5%, and rural was 15.1%. However, it is important to acknowledge that rural residents experienced more asthma-like symptoms (wheezing, whistling, and coughing) than those in urban areas, rural residents had 5% more asthma like symptoms. Also, residents in large urban areas were less likely to use medical services for asthma symptoms.

Multiple factors contribute to socioeconomic disparities, income and education, pollutant exposures and allergens are uncontrollable influences on an individual. Stressors related to neighborhood violence and safety, behavioral risk factors, and lack of access to adequate medications and healthcare also contribute to an increased prevalence of asthma. Low income alone accounts for a significant increase in poor asthma outcomes, including severity, lung function, and morbidity rates.

Secondhand smoke is a common exposure for asthmatic children in low-income households. Children who live with at least one smoker are more likely to have asthma than those who don't. People living below the poverty line and with less education have a higher second-hand smoke exposure than those who do not. Also, those with blue-collar jobs are more likely to be exposed at work, as well as those with service jobs (servers and bartenders) are exposed to smoke at businesses that do not have smoking restrictions.

 Gender 
Globally, there are 136 million women with asthma, 57% of the 235 million people living with asthma. In addition to being more common among women, women experience more severe symptoms and are more likely to die from asthma. The severity and frequency of asthma complications is related to both gender and age. Although asthma is more prevalent and more severe in boys among children, many women experience a significant worsening of symptoms around and after puberty. The timing of the change in prevalence and severity around puberty suggest that asthma pathogenesis is related to sex hormones or hormone levels.

Between 2014-15 and 2019-20 more than 5,100 women in the United Kingdom died from an asthma attack compared with fewer than 2,300 men. Based on emergency hospital admissions in England, among all admissions 20 to 49 years old, women were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for asthma treatment compared with men.

Asthma and Allergy Friendly,"Asthma & Allergy Friendly is a registered certification mark operated by Allergy Standards Limited in association with not-for-profit asthma and/or allergy organizations. They specialise in labelling products which have been put through and have passed standardised testing. 
The ''Asthma & Allergy Friendly'' Certification Program was created to scientifically test and identify consumer products that are more suitable for people with asthma and allergies.


Background
The avoidance of triggers and/or National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute that an asthma management plan should include avoidance of as many allergens as possible to which the individual is sensitive. This report and others also assert that no single specific measure is sufficient to reduce allergens: An allergen reduction plan, which encompasses a variety of approaches is necessary to address management of asthma symptoms.

Certification mark
''Asthma & Allergy Friendly'' is a registered certification mark operated by Allergy Standards Limited in association with not-for-profit asthma and/or allergy organizations in the country of operation. Products are subjected to standardised testing and if they pass, are deemed ''Asthma & Allergy Friendly''. The Asthma & Allergy Friendly Certification Program has been implemented in a number of countries, such as: 
* The United States (in association with the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America), 

File:US-General-mark.jpg|asthma & allergy friendly US mark

* Canada (in association with Asthma Canada)

Certification process
 Overview of the standards 
Standards assess products for the presence of allergenic dyes and sensitizing chemicals  as well as the capacity for allergen retention and ability to withstand eradication techniques such as repeated washing machine cycles. Product areas that have been certified include textile materials, electrical appliances, building products and kids toys. 

 Prerequisites 
Products seeking to be certified ''asthma & allergy friendly'' must pass Allergy Standards rigorous testing standards.  Manufacturers must submit their products for testing to Allergy Standards Ltd approved third party laboratories. Products must be submitted from current production and consumer ready. In order to pass the standards, products must meet the criteria of the standard relevant to the product category. 

 Laboratory tests 
Certification standards are tailored to the specific product categories. Criteria in the standards may include low or no Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions, free from banned dyes and allergens according to best international practice, and capable of either providing a barrier to allergens or effectively removing allergen from the environment. Importantly, products must also demonstrate that they are capable of carrying out their function effectively and are of acceptable quality and construction. For example textiles must be evaluated for barrier function, but must also demonstrate barrier function after washing.  Vacuum cleaners must demonstrate effective allergen removal, but this is also assessed when the bag is near capacity, demonstrating no significant loss of power and no redistribution of dust and allergens.

Allergy Standards Limited
Allergy Standards Limited is an International Standards and Certification Body that prepares independent standards for a wide range of products to declare their suitability for people whose lives are affected by allergies and asthma. Their headquarters are based in Dublin, Ireland. 

Allergy Standards published a white paper on Allergens and Irritants in Household Cleaning Products in the Household and Personal Care Today peer reviewed journal

References and notes"
Creola bodies,"Creola bodies are a histopathologic finding indicative of asthma.  Found in a patient's sputum, they are ciliated columnar cells sloughed from the bronchial mucosa of a patient with asthma.  Other common findings in the sputum of asthma patients include Charcot-Leyden crystals, Curschmann's Spirals, and eosinophils (and excessive amounts of sputum).

Yoshihara et al. reported 60% of pediatric asthmatic patients demonstrating acute symptoms were found to have creola bodies in their sputum. These patients had increased levels of neutrophil-mediated cytokine activity concluding that ""epithelial damage is associated with a locally enhanced chemotactic signal for and activity of neutrophils, but not eosinophils, during acute exacerbations of paediatric asthma.""

Ogata et al. found significant correlations among the CrB score, the concentration of sputum ECP and %FEV1.0 (p less than 0.001). The CrB score on the day of clinical appraisal significantly correlated with the number 6f days of treatment needed for remission. These results were in keeping with the hypothesis that eosinophils cause desquamation of respiratory epithelial cells resulting in prolongation of asthmatic attacks. Observation of CrB seemed to be useful as a marker of duration of asthmatic attacks."
Asthma Life Impact Scale,"The Asthma Life Impact Scale (ALIS) measure is a disease specific patient reported outcome questionnaire which assesses the impact that asthma has on a patient’s quality of life.

The questionnaire has 22 items, which goes beyond earlier focus on the symptoms, functioning and environmental triggers of asthma and includes emotional issues.

 Development 

The ALIS was developed simultaneously in the UK and the US via interviews and focus groups. It was developed and published in 2010 by Galen Research and funded by Novartis AG. It was the first asthma specific quality of life measure that was developed using Item Response Theory.
Items that were featured on the ALIS include: “asthma restricts my social activities”; “asthma affect my close relationships”, “my illness controls me” and “my asthma affects my interest in sex”.

 International use 

Currently, the ALIS has been translated into 16 different languages, including Russian and Italian."
Exhaled nitric oxide,"thumb|Chemical formula of nitric oxide (NO) together with its molecular size (115 picometer|pm).
In respiratory conditions characterized by cell types in an inflammatory response. The fraction of exhaled NO (FENO) is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis, follow-up and as a guide to therapy in adults and children with asthma. The breath test has recently become available in many well-equipped hospitals in developed countries, although its exact role remains unclear.

Biology

thumb|Three-dimensional model of NO.
In humans, nitric oxide is produced from eNOS), and neuronal (nNOS). The latter two are constantly active in endothelial cells and neurons respectively, whereas iNOS' action can be induced in states like inflammation (for example, by cytokines). In inflammation, several cells use iNOS to produce NO, including eosinophils. As such, eNO (also known as FeNO ""fractional exhaled nitric oxide"") has been dubbed an ''inflammometer''.

Although iNOS is thought to be the main contributor to exhaled NO in asthmatics, studies in mice also point to a role for nNOS.

It was initially thought that exhaled NO derived mostly from the sinuses, which contain high levels of NO. It has subsequently been shown that the lower airways contribute most of the exhaled NO, and that contamination from the sinuses is minimal.

Medical use

Asthma
Patients with asthma have higher eNO levels than other people. Their levels also rise together with other clinical and laboratory parameters of asthma (for example, the amount of eosinophils in their sputum). In conditions that trigger inflammation such as upper respiratory tract infections or the inhalation of allergens or plicatic acid, eNO levels rise. The eNO levels also tend to vary according to the results of lung function test results such as the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Furthermore, drugs used to treat asthma (such as inhaled glucocorticoids or leukotriene receptor antagonists) also reduce eNO levels.

Clinical trials have looked at whether tailoring asthma therapy based on eNO values is better than conventional care, in which therapy is gauged by symptoms and the results of lung function tests. To date, the results in both adults and children have been modest and this technique can not be universally recommended. It has also been noted that factors other than inflammation can increase eNO levels, for example airway acidity.

The fraction of eNO has been found to be a better test to identify asthmatics than basic lung function testing (for airway obstruction). Its specificity is comparable to sensitive. This means that a positive eNO test might be useful to rule in a diagnosis of asthma; however, a negative test might not be as useful to rule it out.

Other conditions
The role for eNO in other conditions is even less well established compared to asthma.

Since asthma can be a cause of chronic coughing (it may even be the sole manifestation, such as in cough-variant asthma), studies have looked at whether eNO can be used in the diagnosis of chronic cough. 

Exhaled NO is minimally increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but levels may rise in sudden worsenings of the disease (acute exacerbations) or disease progression. Early findings indicate a possible role for eNO in predicting the response to inhaled glucocorticoids and the degree of airway obstruction reversibility.

Children with cystic fibrosis have been found to have low eNO levels. In subjects with bronchiectasis (a state of localized, irreversible dilatation of part of the bronchial tree) not due to cystic fibrosis, high levels have been found. Sarcoidosis could also feature increased eNO. Low levels have been found in primary ciliary dyskinesia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. In the latter condition, ''inhaled'' NO is used as a diagnostic test of the response of the pulmonary arteries to vasodilators (agents that relax the blood vessels).

eNO has also been associated with wheeze, rhinitis and nasal allergy in primary school children.

Exposure to air pollution has been associated with decreased, and increased eNO levels.

Measurement techniques
thumb|An experimental setup used to measure the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in human breath samples. The subject blows into the tube (1) after a mouthpiece (2) has been connected to it. The wires on the side are part of the system that measures parameters like breath velocity, while the exhaled gas is taken to a FeNO analyzer (3).
The most widely used technique to measure eNO is with a proportional to the amount of exhaled NO.
thumb|evernoa medical device for measurement of exhaled nitric oxide
The subject can exhale directly into a measurement device ('online' technique), or into a reservoir that can afterwards be connected to the analyser ('offline' technique). With the former technique, the early and later NO in the breath sample can be analysed separately. The test requires little coordination from the subject, and children older than 4 can be tested successfully.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK have published guidance on available measuring devices: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/dg12

Reference range
The upper normal level of eNO in different studies ranges from 20 to 30 parts per billion. However, several major features influence the reference values. Men have higher eNO values than women. Smoking notoriously lowers eNO values, and even former smoking status can influence results. The levels are higher in people with an atopic constitution (a tendency towards allergies). The fraction of eNO is also flow-dependent (higher at lower flow rates and vice versa), so measurements are normally measured at 50 ml/s. Age or height could also considerably confound eNO values in children. The magnitude of these effects lies in the order of 10%, so even single cut-off values might be useful.

History
Until the 1980s, nitric oxide, a product of fossil fuel combustion, was thought only to play a role the detrimental effects of air pollution on the respiratory tract. In 1987, experiments with coronary arteries showed that nitric oxide was the long sought endothelium-derived relaxing factor. After scientists realised that NO played a biological role, its role as a cell signalling molecule and neurotransmitter became clear from abundant studies.

NO was first detected in exhaled breath samples in 1991. In 1992, NO was voted molecule of the year by the scientific journal ''Science''. In 1993, researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden were the first to report increased eNO in asthmatics.

Today, NO is not only used in breath tests but also as a therapeutic agent for conditions such as pulmonary arterial hypertension and possibly for the acute respiratory distress syndrome."
Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions,"Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions, also termed alcohol-induced asthma and alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms, are increasingly recognized as a pathological alcohol that afflicts many people with a ""classical"" form of asthma, the airway constriction disease evoked by the inhalation of allergens.  Alcohol-induced respiratory reactions reflect the operation of different and often racially related mechanisms that differ from those of classical, allergen-induced asthma.

 History 
In 1973, Breslin et al. tested the effects of alcoholic beverage consumption on the respiratory symptoms of 11 asthmatic subjects who gave a history of asthma attacks following certain alcoholic beverages.  In response to ingesting the type of beverage that the subjects reported to provoke their symptoms, six developed the asthmatic symptom of chest tightness, two developed a symptom often associated with asthma, rhinitis, and one subject developed both chest tightness and rhinitis.  Symptoms developed almost immediately after ingestion. Inhalation of fumes from the beverages did not precipitate symptoms. And bronchoconstriction in response to the ingestion was confirmed in the three patients evaluated by pulmonary function tests.  The study suggested that these reactions were induced by non-alcoholic allergens that were contained in or contaminated the beverages.  

In 1978 a non-asthmatic female of Japanese descent with a history of moderately severe bronchoconstriction responses to various alcoholic beveragesAm Rev Respir Dis. 1978 Jul;118(1):135-9 and in 1981 an asthmatic Japanese male with a similar history with beer or 95% pure ethanol were studied. They were found to develop bronchoconstriction after drinking apple juice containing alcohol. Intravenous infusion or inhalation of ethanol also caused bronchospasm responses in the male subject.  These studies suggested that alcohol itself caused the asthmatic symptoms triggered by alcoholic beverages.  

A subsequent study in 1986 found that 9 of 18 patients with a history of red-wine-induced asthma symptoms showed bronchoconstriction in response to ingesting red wine; the response correlated positively with the amount of sulfur dioxide contained in the provocative wine.  The study suggested that the reaction was not allergen-induced but rather triggered by sulfur dioxide, a sulfur-dioxide-related agent, or an agent whose levels in alcohol beverages correlated positively with those of sulfur dioxide.  

Finally, a questionnaire survey of 366 asthmatic patients conducted in 2000 found that 33% reported asthma symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages; there was a significant association between wine-induced asthma and asthma triggered by sulfite-containing foods, by aspirin, and by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) other than aspirin.  The study suggested the salicylate-""contaminates"" in wine may contribute to these responses.  

In other studies, D.P. Agarwal and colleagues associated race-based variations in the activity of alcohol-metabolizing enzymes with the occurrence of alcohol flush reactions to alcohol and alcoholic beverages in certain Asian populations.  This early work is the basis for further studies that have defined not only many alcohol-induced flush reactions but also many alcohol-induced respiratory reactions as due to racially associated genetic differences in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes.

 In Asians 
Alcohol-induced asthma reactions among Asians has been most thoroughly studied in those of native Japanese descent.  In such individuals, the ingestion of virtually any alcoholic beverage or pure ethanol and, in some cases, the smelling of ethanol fumes may be followed, typically within 1–30 minutes, by one or more of the following symptoms: an alcohol flush reaction (i.e. the ""Asian flush syndrome""), rapid heart rate, dizziness, light-headedness, urticaria, systemic dermatitis, rhinitis, and, in about half of individuals with a history of asthma, exacerbation of asthmatic bronchoconstriction and related symptoms.Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 2013 Dec;111(6):439-45.  In extremely rare instances, asthmatic symptoms in response to alcoholic beverages may occur in the absence of a history of asthma, and cardiovascular collapse, anaphylaxis, and even death may occur.  These reactions appear due to a deficiency in the metabolism of the ethanol in the alcoholic beverage.

Humans metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde primarily through NAD-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) class I enzymes (i.e. ADH1A, ADH1B, and ADH1C), and then metabolize acetaldehyde primarily by NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) to acetic acid.  East Asians have a deficiency in acetaldehyde metabolism in a surprisingly high percentage (approaching half) of their populations.  The deficiency has been most thoroughly investigated in native Japanese who have a variant ALDH2 allele termed glu487lys, ALDH2*2 or ALDH2*504lys, which is a single nucleotide polymorphism allele encoding in its amino acid residue 487 (glutamic acid) rather than lysine. In the Japanese population, about 57% of individuals are homozygous for the normal allele (sometimes termed ALDH2*1), 40% are heterozygous for glu487lys, and 3% are homozygous for glu487lys.  Since ALDH2 assembles and functions as a tetramer and since ALDH2 tetramers containing one or more glu487lys proteins are also essentially inactive, the glu487lys protein behaves as a dominant negative in inactivating the normal ALDH2 protein. Individuals homozygous for glu487lys have undetectable ALDH2 activity, while heterozygote individuals for glu487lys have little ALDH2 activity.  

In consequence, Japanese homozygous or, to a lesser extent, heterozygous for glu487lys metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde normally, but metabolize acetaldehyde poorly and are thereby susceptible to a set of adverse responses to ethanol and ethanol-containing beverages. These responses include the transient accumulation of acetaldehyde in blood and tissues; facial flushing urticaria, systemic dermatitis, and alcohol-induced respiratory reactions (i.e. rhinitis and, primarily in patients with a history of asthma, mild to moderately bronchoconstriction exacerbations of their asthmatic disease.  These allergic-reaction-like symptoms, which typically occur within 30–60 minutes of ingesting alcoholic beverages, do not appear to reflect the operation of classical IgE- or T cell-related allergen-induced reactions, but rather are due, at least in large part, to the action of acetaldehyde in stimulating tissue mast cells and blood-borne basophils to release histamine, the probable evoker of these symptoms.Hum Mol Genet. 2009 Feb 1;18(3):580-93.  
  
The percentages of glu487lys heterozygous plus homozygous genotypes follow: ~35% in native Caboclo of Brazil, 30% in Chinese, 28% in Koreans, 11% in Thai people, 7% in Malaysians, 3% in natives of India, 3% in Hungarians, and 1% in Filipinos. The percentages are essentially 0% in individuals of Native African descent, Caucasians of Western European descent, Turks, Australian Aborigines, Australians of Western European descent, Swedish Lapps, and Alaskan Eskimos.  While the prevalence of flushing reactions is high in those non-Japanese populations that have a high prevalence of the glu487lys genotype, the percentages of these non-Japanese individuals with the glu487lys allele who experience respiratory symptoms, particularly asthmatic exacerbations, has yet to be defined.  

Alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms result from a wide range of interacting genetic, metabolic, environmental, and social factors  These interacting factors are likely to vary from one nationality group to another and thereby alter, perhaps dramatically, the phenotype produced by the glu487lys allele: the alcohol-induce reactions of Japanese with the glu487lys allele may not be good predictors of those occurring in other nationality groups. ""Social factors"", despite claims made by social constructionists, have no impact on a genetic aldehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.

In non-Asians
The prevalence of ethanol-induced allergic symptoms in non-Asian genotypes commonly ranges above 5%, even though many of these non-Asian populations have no or very low levels of individuals bearing the glu487lys allele.  These ""ethanol reactors"" may have other gene-based abnormalities that cause the accumulation of acetaldehyde following the ingestion of ethanol or ethanol-containing beverages.  For example, the surveyed incidence of self-reported ethanol-induced flushing reactions in Scandinavians living in Copenhagen as well as Australians of European descent is about ~16% in individuals homozygous for the ""normal"" ADH1B gene, but runs to ~23% in individuals with the ADH1-Arg48His Single-nucleotide polymorphism variant. In vitro, this variant metabolizes ethanol rapidly and, it is proposed but not proven, in humans may form acetaldehyde at levels exceeding ALDH2's acetaldehyde-metabolizing capacity.  Presumably then, acetaldehyde provokes the respiratory symptoms in a manner similar to that occurring in Asians with the glu487lys ALDH2 variant.

In studies conducted in the USA and presumably therefore mainly on non-Asians, alcohol-induced rhinitis and exacerbations of asthma reactions are highly associated with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease reactions; more than half of individuals suffering from the aspirin-induced sensitivity reaction will also suffer alcohol-induced reactions.

It seems likely, although further study is needed, that most respiratory symptoms induced by alcoholic beverages, particular wines and beers, occurring in non-Asian individuals are due to true allergic  responses to the allergens that are part of, or contaminate, these drinks.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of alcohol-induced respiratory symptoms can be strongly suggested on the basis of survey questionnaires.  Questionnaires can be devised to determine the specific types of alcoholic beverages eliciting reactions. Reactions evoked by one or only a few but not other types of alcoholic beverage, particularly when the offending beverage(s) is wine and/or beer, suggest that the reactions are due to classical allergic reaction to allergens in the beverage; reactions to all or most types of alcoholic beverages favors a genetic (i.e. acetaldehyde-induced) basis.  Further differentiation between these two causes can be tested under medical supervision by determining if ingestion of a  water-diluted pure ethanol solution elicits reactions or if an offending alcoholic beverage but not the same beverage without ethanol elicits reactions. Either result would favor an acetaldehyde-induced genetic basis for the reaction.     
   
Diagnosis of alcohol sensitivity due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in individuals bearing the glu487lys ALDH2 allele can be made by measuring the diameter of the erythema (i.e. red) area developing under a 15 millimeter skin patch plaster soaked in 70% ethanol and applied for 48 hours (ethanol patch test). Erythema of 15 millimeters is considered positive, with a false positive ratio (100 x {number of individuals with a positive patch test}/{number of individuals with a normal ALDH2 genotype}) of 5.9% and a false negative ratio (100 x {number of individuals with a negative patch test}/{number of individuals with a glu487lys ALDH2 allele}) of 0%.  To resolve ambiguities in or replace the ethanol patch test for other reasons, a polymerase chain reaction using special primers and conditions can be used to directly detect the glu487lys ALDH2 genes.  For other causes of acetaldehyde-induced alcohol sensitivities, the ethanol patch test will need to be tested for verification of its acetaldehyde basis and appropriate polymerase chain reactions will likewise be needed to  verify a genetic basis for symptoms.

Diagnosis of alcohol sensitivity due to allergic reactivity to the allergens in alcoholic beverages can be confirmed by standard skin prick tests, skin patch tests, blood tests, challenge tests, and challenge/elimination tests as conducted for determining the allergen causing other classical allergic reactions (see allergy and Skin allergy tests.)

 Treatment 
Avoidance of ethanol is the safest, surest, and cheapest treatment.  Indeed, surveys find a positive correlation between high incidence of glu487lys ALDH2 allele-related alcohol-induced respiratory reactions as well as other causes of these reactions and low levels of alcohol consumption, alcoholism, and alcohol-related diseases.  Evidently, people suffering these reactions self-impose avoidance behavior. Ethanol, at moderate to high concentrations, is used as a solvent to dissolve many types of medicines and other ingredients.  This pertains particularly to liquid cold medicines and mouthwashes.  Ethanol avoidance includes avoiding ingesting and (depending on an individual's history) mouth-washing with such agents.

Type H1 antagonists in the histamine antagonist family of drugs were tested in Japanese volunteers with alcohol-induced asthma (who presumably have glu487lys ALDH2 allele-associated asthma) and found to be completely effective in blocking bronchoconstriction responses to alcoholic beverages. These blockers, it is suggested, may be taken 1–2 hours before consumption of alcohol beverages as a preventative of alcohol-induced respiratory reactions.  In the absence of specific studies on the prevention of classical alcohol-induced rhinitis and asthma due to allergens in alcoholic beverages, see asthma section on Prevention and rhinitis section on Prevention of allergen-induced reactions.

In the absence of specific studies on the treatment of acute alcohol-induced bronchoconstriction and rhinitis, treatment guidelines should probably follow those of their comparable allergen-induced classical allergic reactions (see asthma section on Treatment and rhinitis section on Treatment), but possibly favoring the testing of H1 antagonist anti-histamines as part of the initial protocol."
Peak expiratory flow,"The peak expiratory flow (PEF), also called peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and peak flow measurement, is a person's maximum speed of expiration, as measured with a peak flow meter, a small, hand-held device used to monitor a person's ability to breathe out air. It measures the airflow through the bronchi and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. Peak expiratory flow is typically measured in units of liters per minute (L/min).

Function
thumb|Peak flow meter (made in USA)
Peak flow readings are higher when patients are well, and lower when the airways are constricted. From changes in recorded values, patients and doctors may determine lung functionality, the severity of asthma symptoms, and treatment.

Measurement of PEFR requires training to correctly use a meter and the normal expected value depends on the patient's sex, age, and height. It is classically reduced in obstructive lung disorders such as asthma.

Due to the wide range of 'normal' values and the high degree of variability, peak flow is not the recommended test to identify asthma. However, it can be useful in some circumstances.

A small portion of people with asthma may benefit from regular peak flow monitoring. When monitoring is recommended, it is usually done in addition to reviewing asthma symptoms and frequency of reliever medication use.

When peak flow is being monitored regularly, the results may be recorded on a peak flow chart. 

It is important to use the same peak flow meter every time.

 Scales or reference values 

thumb|300px|Normal values, shown on EU scale.

To interpret the significance of peak expiratory flow measurements, a comparison is made to reference (normal, predicted) values based on measurements taken from the general population. Various reference values have been published in the literature and vary by population, ethnic group, age, sex, height and weight of the patient. For this reason, tables or charts are used to determine the normal value for a particular individual. More recently, medical calculators have been developed to calculate predicted values for peak expiratory flow. There are a number of non-equivalent scales used in the interpretation of peak expiratory flow.<!--
  -->

Some examples of Reference Values are given below. There is a wide natural variation in results from healthy test subjects.

In 2004 the UK switched from the original Wright scale to the newer, more accurate European scale. Wright values may be converted to the EU scale using the following formula<!--
  -->:

:  \text{EU}  50.356 + 0.4W + (8.814\times10^{-4} \times W^2) - (1.116\times10^{-7} \times W^3)

The reverse calculation is:

:  W  -61.1 + 1.798 \text{EU} - (1.594\times10^{-3} \times \text{EU}^2) + (7.713\times10^{-7} \times \text{EU}^3)

Where W is the value in the Wright scale.

These formulas have also been trended over time in both rural and metropolitan areas both as air quality studies and as studies on asthma due to the Peak Flow measurement's accuracy as a predictor of mortality and poor prognosis.

 Measurement 
Measurements may be based on 1 second or less but are usually reported as a volume per minute. Electronic devices will sample the flow and multiply the sample volume(Litres) by 60, divided by the sample time(seconds) for a result measured in L/minute :  \frac{\text{sample volume} \times 60}{\text{sample time}}

The highest of three readings is used as the recorded value of the Peak Expiratory Flow Rate. It may be plotted out on graph paper charts together with a record of symptoms or using peak flow charting software. This allows patients to self-monitor and pass information back to their doctor or nurse.<!--
  --> - for recording chart of PEFR readings

Peak flow readings are often classified into 3 zones of measurement according to the American Lung Association; green, yellow, and red. Doctors and health practitioners can develop an asthma management plan based on the green-yellow-red zones.

History
The measurement of peak expiratory flow was pioneered by Martin Wright, who produced the first meter specifically designed to measure this index of lung function. Since the original design of instrument was introduced in the late 1950s, and the subsequent development of a more portable, lower cost version (the ""Mini-Wright"" peak flow meter), other designs and copies have become available across the world."
Respiratory risks of indoor swimming pools,"thumb|Indoor Swimming Pool
Respiratory risks of indoor swimming pools can include coughing, wheezing, aggravated asthma, and airway hyper-responsiveness (spasms of the bronchial tubes in the lungs causing coughing and chest tightness). The chemicals used for pool water disinfection can react with organic compounds in the water to create disinfection by-products or DBPs. Exposure to these DBPs are the potential cause for respiratory symptoms in swimmers. Multiple studies have shown the potential correlation between chronic exposure to DBPs and respiratory symptoms among competitive swimmers but more research is needed on the effects of these DBPs on recreational swimmers. The studies on recreational swimmers that have been done show a decreased risk for respiratory symptoms due to a decreased exposure to DBPs. Some studies have been done on the vulnerability of younger children and DBP exposure. Studies done on the vulnerability of younger children demonstrate that immature lungs are more likely to absorb more of these DBPs."
Thunderstorm asthma,"thumb|right|A thunderstorm in Tamworth, New South Wales, Australia
thumb|Colourised scanning electron microscope image of pollen grains from a variety of common plants

Thunderstorm asthma (also referred to in the media as thunder fever or a pollen bomb) is the triggering of an asthma attack by environmental conditions directly caused by a local thunderstorm. Due to the acute nature of the onset and wide exposure of local populations to the same triggering conditions, severe epidemic thunderstorm asthma events can put significant and unmanageable stress on public health facilities.

Widely recognised but not fully understood, it has been proposed that during a thunderstorm, pollen grains can absorb moisture and then burst into much smaller fragments with these fragments being easily dispersed by wind. While larger pollen grains are usually filtered by hairs in the nose, the smaller pollen fragments are able to pass through and enter the lungs, triggering the asthma attack.

History
The phenomenon of thunderstorm asthma has been recognised since the 1980s, with an event in Birmingham, England, in July 1983 often considered the first prominent example. A 2013 study which reviewed instances of abnormally high asthma-related admissions to emergency departments between 1983 and 2013 identified strong correlation between those instances and thunderstorms, while noting that such events were so rare that very little detailed research into the phenomenon had occurred.

A significant impetus in the study of the phenomenon occurred after an event in November 2016 in Melbourne, Australia. Recognised as the most severe epidemic thunderstorm asthma event on record, the onset overwhelmed the city's ambulance system and some local hospitals, saw a ten-fold increase in asthma cases presenting to emergency departments compared with average, and resulted in ten deaths. One month later, an epidemic thunderstorm asthma event in Kuwait resulted in at least 5 deaths and many admissions to the ICU.

Since then there have been further reports of epidemic thunderstorm asthma events in Wagga Wagga, Australia; London, England; Naples, Italy; Atlanta, United States; and Ahvaz, Iran.

Statistics
Many of those affected during a thunderstorm asthma outbreak may have never experienced an asthma attack before.

It has been found 95% of those that were affected by thunderstorm asthma had a history of hayfever, and 96% of those people had tested positive to grass pollen allergies, particularly rye grass. A rye grass pollen grain can hold up to 700 tiny starch granules, measuring 0.6 to 2.5 μm, small enough to reach the lower airways in the lung.

 Prevention 
Patients with a history of grass allergies should be tested for asthma and treated for the grass allergies and asthma if also present. Patients with known asthma should be treated and counseled on the importance of adherence to preventative medication protocols. Preventative treatment found useful for severe asthma includes Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) particularly sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).

Allergies in children,"Allergies in children, an incidence which has increased over the last fifty years, are overreactions of the immune system often caused by foreign substances or genetics that may present themselves in different ways. There are multiple forms of testing, prevention, management, and treatment available if an allergy is present in a child. In some cases, it is possible for children to outgrow their allergies.

Morbidity

Children affected by allergies in the developed world:
* 1 in 13 have eczema
* 1 in 8 have allergic rhinitis
* 3-6% are affected by food allergy

Children in the United States under 18 years of age:
* Percent with any allergy: 27.2%
* Percent with seasonal allergy: 18.9%
* Percent with eczema: 10.8%
* Percent with food allergy: 5.8%

Children in the United Kingdom:
* 1 in 6 with eczema
* 1 in 5 with allergic rhinitis
* 7.1% of breast-fed infants who develop food allergies

Pathophysiology

A child's allergy is an immune system reaction to a foreign substance, or allergen, that is considered harmless to most. According to Dr. James Fernandez with the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University, ""Genetic and environmental factors work together to contribute to the development of allergies."" Upon contact with an allergen, a child’s immune system produces antibodies which patrol the body for future encounters with the invader. During any future encounters, the antibodies release immune system chemicals, such as histamine, that cause allergy symptoms in the nose, lungs, throat, sinuses, ears, eyes, skin, or stomach lining. The development and symptoms of asthma can also be triggered by allergies; indoor allergens and indoor volatile organic compounds, such as formaldehyde, have been known to do so. Anthony Durmowicz, M.D., a pediatric pulmonary doctor at the FDA also says that, if a child has both allergies and asthma, ""not controlling the allergies can make asthma worse.""

Risk Factors

Children are already at a higher risk of developing an allergy due to their age. 
Other risk factors include:
* Having a family history of allergies or asthma
* Having asthma or other allergies/allergic conditions

Causes/Allergens

* Heat & cold
* Excessive sweating
* Stress & anxiety 
* Infections

Signs/Symptoms

According to the Mayo Clinic, “Allergy symptoms, which depend on the substance involved, can affect your airways, sinuses and nasal passages, skin, and digestive system.” The severity of the following symptoms varies from child to child.

The symptoms of indoor and outdoor allergies in children may include:
* Runny nose
* Itchy, watery eyes
* Sneezing
* Itchy nose or throat
* Nasal congestion

Symptoms of indoor allergies can occur year-round but tend to be more troublesome during the winter months when children are inside more often. However, outdoor allergies, or seasonal allergies, normally change with the season.

The potential symptoms of a food allergy include:
* Tingling/itching in the mouth
* Swelling of the lips, tongue, face, throat, or other body parts
* Hives, itching, or eczema
* Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting
* Anaphylaxis (life-threatening)

Possible symptoms of a drug allergy include:
* Hives
* Itchy skin
* Rash
* Facial swelling
* Wheezing
* Anaphylaxis

Symptoms of a potential insect bite/sting allergy include:
* A large area of swelling (edema) at the bite/sting site
* Itching or hives all over the body
* Cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath
* Anaphylaxis

Symptoms of allergic skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis, or eczema, include:
* Itching
* Redness
* Flaking

Diagnosis

There are some different ways that can lead allergists to an official diagnosis of an allergy. These methods include:
* Family history of allergies
* A diary with potential triggers or foods the child eats and reactions to them
* Elimination diet
* Skin tests (skin prick test and intradermal test)
* Blood test (allergen-specific serum IgE test)
* Provocative testing (oral food challenge, etc.)

Family medical history can be used to help determine if a child may have an allergy because of genetics. ""Genes are thought to be involved because specific mutations are common among people with allergies and because allergies tend to run in families."" However, it is not the specific allergies that are passed down, just the likelihood of developing allergies.

Keeping a diary of the child’s symptoms and possible triggers can help an allergist determine if the child has an allergy or guide decisions for further testing. The possible allergens tracked in this manner include food, skin, indoor and outdoor allergens. Keeping track of when the symptoms appear/the reaction occurs can also help determine the possible triggers, as ""food allergy symptoms usually develop within minutes to 2 hours after eating the offending food.""

An elimination diet involves complete avoidance of suspected food allergens for 1–2 weeks and readding them to the child’s diet one at a time to watch for symptoms. This method, however, may not always be accurate in identifying food allergies because it also works for determining food sensitivities/intolerances, which are different.

thumb|Skin Prick Test
There are two types of skin tests that are commonly used for diagnosing allergies. The first one done is the skin prick test, which can identify most allergens. This test involves pricking a needle through a drop of each control and allergen test solutions into the child’s skin. The intradermal test may be done second if no allergen is identified with the skin prick test. This test is more sensitive and involves injecting tiny amounts of the control and allergen test solutions into the child’s skin with a needle. For either test, any allergies will result with a wheal and flare reaction (swelled center and surrounding circular red area) at the pinprick site. For accurate results, any child undergoing either test will need to stop taking any drugs/medications that may suppress a reaction.

For children who cannot receive either skin test, the blood test is used to determine ""whether IgE in the person's blood binds to the specific allergen used for the test."" IgE is immunoglobulin E – the antibody produced by the immune system to protect the body from the ""invader."" A specific allergy can be confirmed if binding occurs with that allergen.
Provocative testing for any type of allergen involves directly exposing the child to small but increasing amounts of a suspected allergen. It is done at a doctor’s office by a doctor who can confirm the allergy if a reaction occurs during the test.

Prevention, Management, & Treatments

There is no cure for allergies, making the avoidance of allergens one of the most important ways to prevent a reaction. Keeping a diary of symptoms, potential triggers, activities, and what helps reduce symptoms is also a helpful form of prevention and management.

For pet allergies, it may help to keep pet-free zones in the house (bedrooms), give furry friends frequent baths, have kids wash hands after petting and avoid touching their eyes, and use over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine to reduce symptoms. These OTC allergy medications include antihistamines, such as Benadryl, Claritin, and Allegra, and nasal corticosteroids, such as Flonase and Afrin. However, it is important to consult a doctor before taking any new medications. OTC medications may not work for every child, but a doctor may be able to prescribe a different, stronger medication or alternative treatment. Immunotherapy in the form of allergy shots is one alternative treatment. If the child’s reactions cannot be maintained using these methods, it may be better to find a new home for the pet and get a different one.

For other indoor allergies, thoroughly clean the house, bedding, and stuffed animals frequently. Using special hypoallergenic furniture and covers for bedding, trading carpet for hardwood flooring, dehumidifying, and letting in sunlight may also help with some allergens. If present, cockroaches, mice, and rats should be controlled to reduce symptoms as well.

Outdoor allergy symptoms can be managed by strategically planning outdoor play time, removing shoes and clothes and bathing after playing outside, keeping car and house windows closed and using the air conditioning, planting an allergy-friendly yard for kids, and keeping allergy medicine handy. It may also help to keep leaves and grass clippings away from the house, keep trees and bushes trimmed, and avoid drying clothes on outdoor clotheslines. Allergy shots are another possible means of management/treatment for these allergies as well, if necessary.

Reactions to food allergens can also be prevented in multiple ways. One of these ways is avoiding cross contamination of allergens into safe foods. Keeping hands/gloves, utensils, surfaces, etc. clean is important. Another effective way to avoid these allergens is to read food labels on everything that has one that may be ingested. If a product contains or may contain one of the major nine allergens, the food labels are required to have a special note to inform potential consumers. Other preventative measures include informing the child, relatives, babysitters, teachers, and any other care givers of the child’s allergy and ways to avoid/treat it and avoiding any foods that you are unsure of that were made by others. This could be food at school, a restaurant, or any social gathering.

For bug bite/sting and skin allergens, using fragrance-free skincare products, keeping the skin moisturized, using insect repellent, and wearing protective clothing are some of the easiest ways to prevent a reaction. OTC medications, prescription (steroid) medications and creams, allergy shots, and biologics are also effective ways to manage/treat some skin allergies. It is also best to avoid scratching any affected area(s) as much as possible.

As they get older, some children may outgrow their allergies. Others can also be desensitized to an allergen through exposure to the allergen, but this is a process that takes time and is not always necessary or possible.

Severe Allergies & Reactions

If a child has any severe allergies that may be life-threatening, the Mayo Clinic recommends having the child wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that would inform others of the allergy if the child was ever unable to communicate. It is also crucial to always have an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen, etc.) on hand that is not expired. Antihistamine medications are also helpful.

If the child encounters the allergen and shows signs of anaphylaxis, use the epinephrine auto-injector first, if available, and seek medical help immediately. Antihistamine medication can also help slow the reaction in addition to epinephrine if it has been approved for combination by your doctor. Otherwise, call 911 or your other local emergency number immediately for emergency medical help.

Epidemiology

* Up to 5% of infants that are fed cow's milk-based formula will develop an allergy to cow's milk."
Targeted lung denervation,"Targeted lung denervation (TLD) is a procedure, that is currently being studied, to try to improve chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Evidence to support its use is insufficient as of 2015. TLD is intended to block airway nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system to try to relax the airways. The procedure is done using a balloon catheter through a bronchoscope and uses radio frequency energy. The bronchoscope is passed through the person's mouth and into their lungs. A dual-cooled radiofrequency ablation catheter is passed through the bronchoscope to provide the treatment."
Yokkaichi asthma,"refers to cases of chronic bronchitis, SOx compounds have been proposed. The generally accepted source of the sulfur oxide pollution was the Yokkaichi Kombinato petrochemical processing facilities and refineries built in Yokkaichi between 1959 and 1972 which did not properly desulfurize the high sulfur content in its crude oil. Yokkaichi asthma is considered one of the Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan and was the subject of Japan's first court case related to pollution.

Industry background
In 1899, wealthy Yokkaichi landowner Inaba San'emon transformed Yokkaichi's wetlands into a port for textile exports. Ishihara Industries built an oil refinery in Yokkaichi's remaining marshes in 1937. In 1938, the imperial navy built another oil refinery in Yokkaichi that would later become a target for American air raid bombing during the Pacific War. The oil refineries and a majority of the city were destroyed in 1945. In 1955, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry began its policy to transition Japan's primary fossil fuel source from coal to petroleum, and oil refineries were once again opened in Yokkaichi. The oil used in Yokkaichi was primarily imported from the Middle East, which contained 2% sulfur in sulfur containing compounds, resulting in a white-colored smog developing over the city.

Petrochemical Complex No.1
To accomplish the goal of the government-issued Petrochem Industry Program - Phase I from 1955, the Daichi Petrochemical Complex, a joint project of Showa Oil and Shell Oil Company, began construction in 1956 around the remnants of World War II naval fuel factories in south Yokkaichi Harbor which were destroyed by bombing before their operation began. The location was convenient because waste could easily be dumped into the ocean and Yokkaichi's port provided a means for easily shipping products. Daichi Petrochemical Complex, the first of its kind in Japan, contained an oil refinery, a petrochemical plant, ethylene plant, and a power station when it began operation in 1959. As demand increased, the operation expanded its workday so that production could continue twenty four hours a day.

Petrochemical Complex No.2
In 1960, the government of Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda accelerated the growth of petrochemical production as part of its goal to double individual incomes of Japanese citizens over a 10-year period. The Petrochemical Industry Program - Phase II began as MITI announced that a second complex was to be constructed on reclaimed land in northern Yokkaichi. During its trial run, the complex broke down and expelled odorous runoff that spurred many complaints by citizens. The second complex went online officially in 1963.

Symptoms
Beginning shortly after the opening of the first complex in 1959, severe cases of chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and bronchial asthma rose quickly among the local inhabitants, particularly in the Isozu and Shiohama districts which were closest to the factories, and among males over 50. Other chronic symptoms included sore throat. Symptoms showed some relief when affected people left areas of high air pollution. By 1964, Isozu Village, which was most affected, had 2.5% of the population exhibiting symptoms. A 2008 study by researchers from the Mie University Graduate School of Medicine and the Hiroshima University Natural Science Center for Basic Research and Development indicated a 10- to 20-fold higher mortality rate as a result of COPD and asthma in the affected populations of Yokkaichi versus the general population of Mie Prefecture. Several people with asthma committed suicide, such as Kihira Usaburou, with some writing suicide notes attributing their deaths to the disease.

For one 40-year-old Yokkaichi patient with asthma reported in Respiratory Medicine Case Reports journal, Symptoms showed relief when treated using a vibrating mesh nebulizer.

Environmental effects

Marine life
The fishing industry is considered the first victim of Yokkaichi pollution. Fish caught in Tsukiji, Tokyo were returned to Ise due to complaints, causing local fishermen to petition the government for compensation for their unsaleable fish in 1960. Special Committee of Promotion Council for Ise Bay Industrial Waste Water Pollution Countermeasures was organized by the Mie Prefectural Government in response to the incident and attributed the foul smelling fish and oily water texture to mineral oil in waste water expelled into the bay by nearby petrochemical plants and oil refineries. In 1962 during a factory tour, factory officials interviewed by Research Committee on Pollution founding member Miyamato Ken'ichi maintained despite these findings that the foul smelling fish was due to a sunken ship in Ise bay.

Air quality
Soot and white smog from the petrochemical plants filled the skies of Yokkaichi, and were the main concern of complaints before Petrochemical Complex No. 2 was constructed in 1963. The air was said to have an offensive odor. Researchers in the Journal of Environmental Health found in 1985 that as air quality decreased, mortality rate for bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis cases increased.

Soil quality
A study in 1975 from Mie University in Japan found a significant correlation between the number of Yokkaichi asthma patients and decrease in expected grain yield for May to September summer crops.

| Sulfur dioxide, a toxic gas found in high concentrations in the air of Yokkaichi and initially believed to be the cause of the asthma cases.
|}
All clinical cases of Yokkaichi asthma began after the establishment of the oil refinery and petroleum chemical plants in 1959.

Complaints from citizens of offensive odors spurred investigation. Initially, the suspected sources of the odors included SO2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methylmercaptan, aldehydes, and other substances found to be leaking from the factories. However, sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of high sulfur content oil has typically been attributed as the cause of the disease since the beginning.

Despite common belief that SO2 was the main source of the asthma, by investigating sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide levels in Yokkaichi and analyzing compound toxicity levels, a study conducted in 1984 from Yokohama National University concluded that respiratory diseases were not a result of sulfur dioxide, but rather due to a titanium oxide manufacturing plant venting concentrated sulfuric acid mists downwind onto populated urban areas. The high concentration of Yokkaichi asthma patients in Isozu Village can be farther accounted for under this conclusion, as the source of sulfur trioxide emissions is 2 kilometers south of the most affected population. A 2001 study by several researchers in the Environmental Management journal confirmed by analyzing the effects of SO2 and SO3 on humans that SO3 was likely the real cause of the asthma. They farther propose that one of the reasons flue-gas desulfurization implementation did not lead to the disappearance of all cases was due to differences in SO2 and SO3 cleanup.

Legal action
In 1960, those living in Isozu complained to Yokkaichi officials about noise from the factories and sickness caused by the chemicals, but they were ignored. Children were advised by teachers in Mihana Primary School to avoid breathing as much as possible. When the fishing industries in Yokkaichi began to collapse in spring 1960, the government finally issued a 100 million yen settlement that was to be divided up and distributed by Yokkaichi fishing unions. This settlement did nothing about the source of pollution. In August 1960, The Yokkaichi City Environmental Pollution Control Measures Committee was organized by the city of Yokkaichi prompted by farther citizen complaints. The committee found that the Isozu district had six times the SO2 content in air of the rest of Yokkaichi and concluded that the asthma would likely cause an increase in mortality rate. They found that children were affected the most, and that about half of the children in Isozu district had the disease.

When the pollution did not stop, angry fishermen from Isozu upset with the government's lack of action attempted to plug an industrial drainpipe belonging to Mie electric company with sandbags. To prevent the fishermen from doing so, the company increased emissions and a fight broke out between those working for the company and the fishermen that had to be defused by local officials. This incident led to investigations in Yokkaichi by the national government.

The national government sent out investigators with the issue of the Special Survey Council on Yokkaichi Area Air Pollution in 1963, and they concluded their report in March 1964. Meanwhile, the government offered more compensation to fishermen following findings in 1965. Through the survey council's investigation Yokkaichi became an official target area of the 1968 Soot and Smoke Regulation Law. However, SO2 air pollution did not decrease, most notable through the suicide of confection shop owner Outani Kazuhiko, who wrote a note blaming the bad air for his death. Through this law, taller smokestacks were built, but they simply spread the pollution over a wider area and did not help alleviate the health issues. In 1965, the local government offered more compensation to fishermen following Special Survey Council on Yokkaichi Area Air Pollution findings in what would become the world's first public-relief system for pollution victims. For the first year, this was financed by the local government, but was financed by the national government's treasury in its second year.

Isozu district Yokkaichi residents with asthma filed a civil suit against companies with ties to Showa Yokkaichi Oil's Petrochemical Complex No. 1 in 1967 which would go on to become Japan's first court trial related to pollution. The trial ended in 1972 in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the company had committed negligence. After the trial, the local Yokkaichi government requested that the city be considered a target area for the 1968 Soot and Smoke Regulation Law. The 1968 Air Pollution Control Law led to the implementation of a flue-gas desulfurization processes for all emissions, which gradually led to health improvement in the local populace.

Other cases

Yokkaichi asthma has been identified in other rapidly industrializing areas in parts of the world, including Nishiyodogawa industrial district of Osaka, Japan."
Curschmann's spirals,"thumb|250px|Curschmann's spiral
Curschmann's spirals are a microscopic finding in the desquamated epithelium seen in lavages from asthmatic patients. These microscopic casts are named after German physician Heinrich Curschmann (1846-1910). They are often seen in association with creola bodies and Charcot-Leyden crystals. They are elongated microscopic mucous casts from small bronchi and are often found in sputum samples from patients with bronchial asthma. They can be stretched out to a length of around 2&nbsp;cm and can sometimes be longer. They have a central core that may be ensheathed in cell debris and mucus."
Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma is new onset asthma or the recurrence of previously quiescent asthma directly caused by exposure to an agent at workplace. It is an occupational lung disease and a type of work-related asthma. Agents that can induce occupational asthma can be grouped into sensitizers and irritants.

''Sensitizer-induced'' occupational asthma is an immunologic form of asthma which occurs due to inhalation of specific substances (i.e., high-molecular-weight proteins from plants and animal origins, or low-molecular-weight agents that include chemicals, metals and wood dusts) and occurs after a latency period of several weeks to years.

''Irritant-induced'' (occupational) asthma is a non-immunologic form of asthma that results from a single or multiple high dose exposure to irritant products. It is usually develops early after exposure; however can also develop insidiously over a few months after a massive exposure to a complex mixture of alkaline dust and combustion products, as shown in the World Trade Center disaster. Unlike those with sensitizer-induced occupational asthma, subjects with irritant-induced occupational asthma do not develop work-related asthma symptoms after re-exposure to low concentrations of the irritant that initiated the symptoms. Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) is a severe form of irritant induced asthma where respiratory symptoms usually develop in the minutes or hours after a single accidental inhalation of a high concentration of irritant gas, aerosol, vapor, or smoke.

Another type of work-related asthma is ''work-exacerbated asthma'' (WEA) which is asthma worsened by workplace conditions but not caused by it. WEA is present in about a fifth of patients with asthma and a wide variety of conditions at work, including irritant chemicals, dusts, second-hand smoke, common allergens that may be present at work, as well as other ""exposures"" such as emotional stress, worksite temperature, and physical exertion can exacerbate asthma symptoms in these patients. Both occupational asthma and work-exacerbated asthma can be present in an individual.

A number of diseases have symptoms that mimic occupational asthma, such as asthma due to nonoccupational causes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), irritable larynx syndrome, hyperventilation syndrome, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and bronchiolitis obliterans.

 Signs and symptoms 
Like other types of asthma, it is characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airways obstruction, and bronchospasm, but it is caused by something in the workplace environment. Symptoms include shortness of breath, tightness of the chest, coughing, sputum production and wheezing. Some patients may also develop upper airway symptoms such as itchy eyes, tearing, sneezing, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea.

Symptoms may develop over many years as in sensitizer induced asthma or may occur after a single exposure to a high-concentration agent as in case of RADS.

 Risk factors
At present, over 400 workplace substances have been identified as having asthmagenic or allergenic properties. Agents such as flour, diisocyanates, latex, persulfate salts, aldehydes, animals, wood dusts, metals, enzymes usually account for the majority cases, however, the distribution of causal agents may vary widely across geographic areas, depending on the pattern of industrial activities. For example, in France the industries most affected are bakeries and cake-shops, automobile industry and hairdressers, whereas in Canada the principal cause is wood dust, followed by isocyanates. Furthermore, the most common cause of occupational asthma in the workplace are isocyanates. Isocyanates are used in the production of motor vehicles and in the application of orthopaedic polyurethane and fibreglass casts.

The occupations most at risk are: adhesive handlers (e.g. acrylate), animal handlers and veterinarians (animal proteins), bakers and millers (cereal grains), carpet makers (gums), electronics workers (soldering resin), forest workers, carpenters and cabinetmakers (wood dust), hairdressers (e.g. persulfate), health care workers (latex and chemicals such as glutaraldehyde), janitors and cleaning staff (e.g. chloramine-T), pharmaceutical workers (drugs, enzymes), seafood processors, shellac handlers (e.g. amines), solderers and refiners (metals), spray painters, insulation installers, plastics and foam industry workers (e.g. diisocyanates), textile workers (dyes) and users of plastics and epoxy resins (e.g. anhydrides)

The following tables show occupations that are known to be at risk for occupational asthma, the main reference for these is the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety.

 Diagnosis
To diagnose occupational asthma it is necessary to confirm the symptoms of asthma and establish the causal connection with the work environment.  Various diagnostic tests can be used to aid in diagnoses of work related asthma.

A spirometer is a device used to measure timed expired and inspired volumes, and can be used to help diagnose asthma.

Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is a hand held device which measures  how fast a person can exhale and is a reliable test for occupational asthma. Serial PEFR can be measured to see if there is a difference in ability to exhale at work compared to that in a controlled environment.

A non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity test can be used to support the diagnose occupational asthma. It involves measuring the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV-1) of the patient before and after exposure to methacholine or mannitol. Presence of airway responsiveness i.e. significant drop in FEV-1 can be seen in patients with occupational asthma.

Specific inhalation challenges test consist of exposing the subjects to the suspected occupational agent in the laboratory and/or at the workplace and assess for asthma symptoms as well as a reduction in FEV1.

Other tests such as skin prick test, serum immunologic testing and measurement of sputum eosinophils can also be useful in establishing the diagnosis of occupational asthma.

 Prevention 
Several forms of preventive measures have been suggested to prevent development of occupational asthma and also detect risk or disease early to allow intervention and improve outcomes. These include: comprehensive programs, education and training, medical examinations, use of medications, reduction of exposures and elimination of exposures. A review on the effectiveness of prevention measurements indicated that removal or reduction of exposure may improve asthma symptoms when compared to uninterrupted exposure. Removal from exposure may improve lung function when compared to continued exposure. Removal from exposure may improve symptoms and lung function more than reduction of exposure among patients exposed to low molecular weight agents, such as isocyanates, diisocyanates, metals and anhydrides. Two studies reported an increased of job loss associated with removal from exposure. Four studies reported a decrease in income of 20% to 50% after removal from exposure. The authors suggested that the benefit of a better improvement in air quality be weighed against the potential for a higher risk of job loss.

thumb|A video on research on preventing asthma in health care
Asthma symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness can persist for several years after removal from the offending environment. Thus, early restriction from exposure to the trigger is advisable. Completely stopping exposure is more effective treatment than reducing exposure, but not always feasible.

Management
Medication

Medications used for occupational asthma are similar to those used for other types of asthma such as short-acting beta-agonists like salbutamol or terbutaline,  long-acting beta-agonists like salmeterol and formoterol and inhaled corticosteroids. Immunotherapy can also be used in some cases of sensitizer induced occupational asthma.

 Epidemiology 
Occupational asthma is one of the most common occupational lung disease. Approximately 17% of all adult-onset asthma cases are related to occupational exposures. About one fourth of adults with asthma have work-exacerbated asthma. Patients with work-related asthma are more likely to experience asthma attacks, emergency room visits, and worsening of their asthma symptoms compared with other adult asthma patients.

Society and culture

 Compensation 

When a person is diagnosed with occupational asthma, it can result in serious socio-economic consequences not only for the workers but also for the employer and the healthcare system because the worker must change positions. The probability of being re-employed is lower for those with occupational asthma compared to those with normal asthma. The employer not only pays compensation to the employee, but will also have to spend a considerable amount of time and energy and funds for hiring and training new personnel. In the United States, it was estimated that the direct cost of occupational asthma in 1996 was $1.2 billion and the indirect cost $0.4 billion, for a total cost of $1.6 billion. In most cases, the employer could have saved more money by adhering to safety standards rather than causing employees to become injured.


However, this can entail severe socio-economic consequences for the worker as well as the employer due to loss of job, unemployment, compensation issues, medical expenditures, and hiring and re-training of new personnel."

''Bronkie the Bronchiasaurus'' is an educational platform video game developed by American studio WaveQuest and published by Raya Systems for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a part of educational video game series from Raya that includes ''Captain Novolin'', ''Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon'' and ''Packy and Marlon''.

Gameplay and plot
The game attempts to teach children about prehistoric city of San Saurian. The explosions covered the earth with clouds of dust, thus causing asthma in the dinosaur world. The dinosaurs built a mighty wind machine to clear the air, but their plans were thwarted by Mr. Rexo, who stole the machine, hid its pieces over San Saurian and forced other dinosaurs to protect them. The two friends, Bronkie and Trakie, with the help of their sidekicks, Sam and Kyla, must find the missing machine parts before the dust returns and save the planet. Bronkie and Trakie can develop shortness of breath from tar, cigarette smoke, furry animals, and other obstacles. Bonus games include learning the proper use of the inhaler and other daily facts of life for people with asthma.

Reception"
Type 2 inflammation,"Type 2 inflammation is a pattern of helminths, but a dysregulation of the type 2 inflammatory response has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several diseases.

 Molecular biology 
IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP are alarmins released from damaged epithelial cells. These cytokines mediate the activation of type 2 T helper cells (Th2 cells), type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2 cells), and dendritic cells. Th2 cells and ILC2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13.

IL-4 further drives CD4+ T cell differentiation towards the Th2 subtype and induces isotype switching to IgE in B cells. IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate trafficking of eosinophils to the site of inflammation, while IL-5 promotes both eosinophil trafficking and production.

 Dysregulation in human disease 
Type 2 inflammation has been implicated in several chronic diseases: 

* Asthma
* Atopic dermatitis
* Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps
* Eosinophilic esophagitis

Persons with one type 2 inflammatory disease are more likely to have other type 2 inflammatory diseases.

 Pharmacological targets 
Several medicines have been developed that target mediators of type 2 inflammation:

* IL-4-specific blockers:
** Altrakincept
** Pascolizumab
* IL-5-specific blockers:
** Benralizumab
** Mepolizumab
** Reslizumab
* IL-13-specific blockers:
** Lebrikizumab
** Tralokinumab
* Dual IL-4 and IL-13 blockers:
** Dupilumab
* IgE-blockers:
** Ligelizumab
**Omalizumab"

Asthma trigger,"thumb|Examples of asthma triggers
Asthma triggers are factors or stimuli that provoke the exacerbation of obstruction of the airway, hypersecretion of breathlessness, wheezing.

An asthma attack is usually mediated by an inflammatory pathway, where a trigger such as an allergen could lead to a series of immune response mediated by various types of immune cells.

Common triggers for asthma include dust mites, molds. Other types of triggers like exercise, air pollutants, tobacco smoke, humidity, cold air, or certain medicines may also play a role in triggering asthma. While it has been proposed that asthma triggers can be classified into three types: allergic triggers, environmental triggers and physical triggers, a universal categorization of asthma triggers has yet to be done. Other studies have also classified asthma triggers into psychological factors, air pollutants, physical activity, allergens and infection.

Asthma is an extremely common chronic disease affecting over 26 million people and 7 million children in the US. Recognizing the trigger for asthma and avoiding it can be a simple yet effective way to deal with the disease and avoid an asthma attack. Although a cure for asthma is yet to be invented, various treatment methods are available for both long-term control and immediate relieve of an asthma attack.

 Pathophysiology 
thumb|Figure showing the physiological changes in the respiratory tract during an asthma attack upon contact with a triggerThe pathophysiology for asthma mainly involves the inflammatory pathway, associated with several types of immune cells in the body, mainly T helper 2 cells (Th2 cells), inflammatory response, causing bronchial hyperresponsiveness, bronchoconstriction, excessive mucus secretion, airflow obstruction and an asthma attack. A more detail rundown of the process is provided below.

First, during the sensitization phase, where Th2 cells, leading to their development. Afterward, the activated Th2 cells would release interleukine-4, a type of IgE antibodies, which are captured by a type of receptor, FceRI, on the mast cells.

digestive tract mucosa. They are equipped with preformed granules loaded with vasoactive amines and FceRI receptors on mast cells capture the IgE antibodies produced by Th2 cells, they become sensitive to the specific allergen.
 
thumb|Diagram showing the typical pathway for an allergic response leading to asthma

Due to this, the mast cells will be activated when they are exposed to the specific allergen. As an allergen binds to the IgE antibodies on the FceRI takes place. This leads to the recruitment and activation of several cytoskeletal rearrangement, allowing vasoactive amines and vasoactive amines such as chemotactic factors and chemotactic factors. These factors attract arachidonic acid enzymatic pathway activation, contributing to the release of lipid mediators. These lipid mediators, particularly pro-inflammatory cytokines transcription. These pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, Interleukin-1 and Interleukin-8 lead to acute inflammation and leukocyte recruitment.

 Examples of asthma triggers 
thumb|Microscopic image of a house dust mite, which can trigger asthma.

 Allergic triggers 
Allergic triggers are factors or chemicals that could induce airway sensitization, inflammation, bronchospasm and other asthmatic symptoms.

Allergens are the most common trigger for allergic asthma. Examples of such triggers of asthma include naturally occurring molds and pests are also potential triggers. When an asthma patient inhales or come into contact withsuch allergen, vasoactive amines and proteases. This leads to a release of cytokines and mediates a broad range of inflammatory and allergic responses.

 Environmental triggers 
In addition to allergens, studies have revealed that environmental factors may also increase the risk of triggering an asthma attack. Examples of these factors include respiratory tract viral infections, exposure to in vivo study has demonstrated that these environmental factors lead to the accumulation of mucus hypersecretion.

Another environmental risk factor is exposure to igE antibodies which can bind to mast cells and lead to hyperresponsiveness of the respiratory tract.

 Exercise 
Exercise induced asthma is common in most asthma patients. Although the mechanism for such a phenomenon is still unclear, researchers have proposed that as the body gasps for more oxygen during exercise, more cold and dry air is inhaled. The passage of this cold and dry air causes a loss of moisture from the mucosal membrane of the cholinergic receptors, which can induce bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion, further narrowing the airway. Swimmers with asthma may also inhale an excess amount of contaminated and irritating air with compound derived from chlorine gas, this can increase the risk of an asthma attack.

 Medications 
thumb|Image of aspirin which can be a trigger for asthma in some patients.
aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, refers to situations where the use of aspirin worsen the asthma conditions.  Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that inhibits the enzyme, cyclooxygenase-1, may also lead to an asthma attack.

After the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme by the NSAIDs, an accumulation of cysteinyl leukotriene receptors in the respiratory system, leading to bronchoconstriction and the over-secretion of mucus, thus blocking the airway.

Beta-blocker, or beta-adrenergic antagonists, may also induce bronchial constriction and block the action of other beta-receptor targeted asthmatic drugs, leading to a worsening asthma condition. Therefore, asthma patients should be cautious and inform their physicians of their asthma conditions.

 Occupational asthma triggers 
diesel, dimethylsulphate, diisocyanates, latex, persulfate, aldehydes, isocyanates, wood dusts and flour should be handled with great care.

 Tobacco smoke 
Both first-hand and second-hand tobacco smoke can be a trigger for asthma attack. It may worsen the condition of asthma as it is an irritant and induces bronchoconstriction.

 Psychological triggers 
Studies have also indicated that psychological stress may be associated with a higher chance of asthma attack. Patients with psychological stress are found to have a reduced awareness of controlling asthma and a less desirable physical health.

 Symptom 
One of the clinical asthmatic symptoms is wheezing. During expiration, turbulent airflow crushes the narrowed respiratory tract, leading to a wheezing sound. Moreover, the increased acute respiratory failure may occur due to the inadequate amount of oxygen in the circulatory system. Another life-threatening condition is pneumothorax, the collapse of the lungs due to hyperinflation.

 Avoidance 
Understanding the specific asthma triggers for a patient and avoiding them can be a simple way for preventing an asthma attack. Regularly washing pest controls, keeping a sensitized living environment, removing stagnant water, avoiding products with potential irritants, etc., can be effective in avoiding an asthma attack.

Education about asthma triggers should be done by physicians to help patients understand what activities or materials should be avoided. Reduction of exposure to asthma triggers should be done by asthmatic patient as well. Parents of asthmatic children should also be cautious of common asthma triggers in order to reduce risks of an asthma attack.

 Treatment 
thumb|Image of an asthma medication inhaler which can be used to administer the medicine through the pulmonary route

 Quick-relief medicine 
Quick-relief medicine are used for treating an acute asthma attack. The first line of medicine for treating this situation is short-term beta-2-adrenoreceptor agonists, which are drugs that can stimulate the beta-2 adrenergic receptors. They are albuterol and levalbuterol. Commonly they are used with a portable inhaler which allow the patient to administer the medicine at once during an attack.

Another common medicine for an acute attack is ipratropium and tiotropium, which are also cholinergic receptors and reduces mucus secretion and bronchoconstriction.

Another type of treatment for acute asthma attack is immunosuppressive drugs like corticosteroids, which can also alleviate an asthmatic response. Examples include prednisone and methyl prednisone which are usually administered orally or intravenously for treating an acute situation. However, note that long term use of corticosteroids may lead to severe side effects.

 Long-term control 
Continuous and long-term use of certain medicines can help reduce the risk of an asthma attack and keep the disease under control.
thumb|Chemical structure of prednisolone, a corticosteroid that can help relief an acute asthma attack
Long term use of certain types of corticosteroids, such as fluticasone propionate may be administered through the pulmonary route to reduce the risk of an asthma attack.

Oral use of leukotriene receptor antagonist such as Zafirlukast may also be used as a long term control for asthma in addition to corticosteroids.

Moreover, another option is the use of cromolyn sodium, which can prevent an asthma attack by halting Ca2+ influx, thus preventing mast cell degranulation and subsequent asthmatic complications 

Other than drugs, an alternative treatment method is de-sensitization, which involves exposure to a well-controlled, small and increasing amounts of specific allergen over a long duration of time. The rationale is to trigger antigen competition by the development of allergen-specific IgG antibodies, which can reduce to risk of an allergic response.

Long-acting beta-agonists such as salmetrol had been used in combination with bronchodilation effect for over 12 hours. However, a recent study in 2010 has found that this treatment method could increase the risk of asthma-related deaths and intubations. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is also recommending the discontinuation of the drug if asthma control has been achieved."
Asthma-COPD overlap,"Asthma-Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Overlap (ACO), also known as Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS) is a chronic inflammatory, obstructive airway disease in which features of both asthma and COPD predominate. Asthma and COPD were once thought of as distinct entities, however in some, there are clinical features of both asthma and COPD with significant overlap in pathophysiology and symptom profile. It is unclear whether ACO is a separate disease entity or a clinical subtype of asthma and COPD. The pathogenesis of ACO is poorly understood, but it is thought to involve both type 2 inflammation (usually seen in asthma) as well as type 1 inflammation (seen in COPD). The incidence and prevalence of ACO are not well known. The risk factors for ACO are also incompletely understood, but tobacco smoke is known to be a major risk factor.

 Signs and Symptoms 
ACO presents with symptoms of both mucous production, cough and episodes of symptomatic worsening known as exacerbations.

 Cause 
A history of significant and persistent noxious fumes exposure is required for the diagnosis of COPD, therefore is also required for the diagnosis of ACO. This can be due to tobacco smoking, indoor air pollution or outdoor air pollution.

 Pathophysiology 
ACOS presents with features of both asthma and COPD. Both asthma and COPD (as well as ACO) present with exacerbations, periods where symptoms deteriorate, with marked reductions in airflow. However,  in asthma, the airflow limitation usually completely resolves after exacerbations, whereas in COPD it may not. ACO presents with a chronic airflow limitation or obstruction (due to inflammation), with characteristics of both asthma and COPD. Inflammation of the large and medium airways (classically seen with asthma) is seen in ACO. This consists of bronchoconstriction due to smooth muscle spasm as well as smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness (due to allergens or irritants) causing obstruction of airflow. Mucous production and inflammation in the airways can also cause airflow obstruction in asthma.

Features of COPD (which includes the subtypes of chronic bronchitis and COPD) are also seen in ACO. These include the features of chronic bronchitis such as inflammation of the small airways and mucous production or hypersecretion. Peribronchial inflammation, which may lead to fibrosis (alveolar destruction resulting in lung hyperinflation and air trapping.

 Diagnosis 
There are no widely accepted diagnostic criteria for ACO, however the diagnosis requires clinical features of both asthma and COPD. One diagnostic criteria, based on expert consensus, first described in 2016, requires the presence of 3 major and at least 1 minor criteria for the diagnosis of ACO. The major criteria are: a persistent airflow limitation (a ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second divided by forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) of less than 0.7 or below the lower limit of normal), a significant exposure history to tobacco smoke (defined as a greater than 10 pack year history)(or significant exposure to other indoor or outdoor air pollution) and a documented history of asthma or a significant improvement in FEV1 (of greater than 400mL) to an inhaled bronchodilator. The minor criteria include a history of atopy or allergic rhinitis, a more limited response to an inhaled bronchodilator (greater than 200 mL improvement in the FEV1 or a 12% improvement from baseline), and peripheral blood eosinophils greater than 300 cells/μL. Spirometry (documenting obstruction) is required for the diagnosis of ACO.

In those with asthma, some features often seen in COPD that may aid in the diagnosis of ACO include emphysema seen on imaging or a decreased diffusion capacity (DLCO)(indicating significant lung tissue damage). In those with COPD, other features often seen in asthma that may aid in the diagnosis of ACO include an increase in the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)(a marker that is specific to the degree of airway inflammation in those with asthma) or increased levels of IgE (either total IgE or specific to inhaled antigens).

 Treatment 
Treatment of ACO is based on expert opinion as there are no universally accepted clinical guidelines. Treatment is usually based on whether clinical features of asthma or COPD predominate. Inhaled corticosteroids are the primary treatment in those with ACOS. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be continued in those with asthma who develop decreased airway responsiveness to bronchodilators consistent with ACO. Therapy can be escalated to include a long acting beta-agonist (LABA) and inhaled steroid combination (ICS-LABA) or by adding on a long-acting anti-muscarinic inhaler (LAMA), known as triple therapy, in those with more severe or resistant disease.

Monoclonal antibodies targeting type 2 inflammation (which is predominant in asthma) have been used to treat severe asthma, and may also be used in severe cases of ACO. These monoclonal antibodies include omalizumab (an Anti-IgE antibody), mepolizumab (an anti-IL-5 antibody) and benralizumab (an anti-IL-5 receptor α antibody). People with ACOS and eosinophilia have a better response to ICS; with fewer exacerbations and hospitalizations seen in ACOS treated with long term ICS. Systemic corticosteroids (intravenous or oral steroids) may be used during exacerbations of ACOS.

 Prognosis 
The progression of permanent airflow obstruction (as measured by the rate of FEV1 decline) is slower in ACO as compared to COPD, but ACO with late onset asthma is associated with a more rapid FEV1 decline (a more rapid progression of obstruction) and a worse prognosis. ACO  with late onset asthma is associated with a higher mortality as compared to COPD, asthma or healthy controls. Excluding ACO with late onset asthma, ACO has better survival (lower mortality) than COPD, but higher mortality compared to asthma. In other studies, ACO was associated with worse dyspnea symptoms, more coughing, wheezing, sputum production as well as more frequent and more severe exacerbations as compared to COPD or asthma.

Epidemiology 
Due to heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria and a paucity of clinical trials, the prevalence of ACO is not well known. Based on a meta analysis, the prevalence of ACO in the general population is estimated to be 2%, whereas the prevalence of ACO in those with asthma is 26.5% and in those with COPD it is 29.6%."
